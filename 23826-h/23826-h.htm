<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Sergeant</span>,</p>
<p>To you I dedicate this sketch of the Life of my late brother,
Henry Cooper; and, for three good reasons&mdash;the first,
because, you were associated with my brother on circuit, knew him
well, and were one of those, who being often opposed to him in
court, were best able to appreciate his talents, eloquence, and
the general powers of his mind;&mdash;my second, because, when
young, I have listened often to your eloquence, and been made
merry by your wit and humour;&mdash;my third, because, you have
known all my family, and by one and all are much
respected;&mdash;and my dear Mr. Sergeant, with kind regards to
yourself, and best wishes to you and yours,</p>

7</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Kind Reader</span>,</p>
<p>In attempting the life of my late brother, who, after
struggling for years at the bar in almost obscurity, had, on a
sudden, his brilliancy noticed and his great talents
acknowledged, and no sooner had he reached that eminence in his
profession, when all was made easy before him, than unpitying
Clolho stept up, and cut his thread of life; I must ask your
indulgence, for the reasons you will see, as you proceed in this
my life of him, as also, from the very scanty materials I have
been able to collect for it.&nbsp; How the first idea of this
suggested itself to my mind, I will tell you; a few days ago, I
was about to re-publish some Dramas, written by me in earlier
years, and thinking one of them would scarcely make a volume by
itself, the <i>thought struck me</i>, on looking over my
treasures, and finding some verses of my brother Henry in his own
hand writing, amidst many youthful rhymes of my own and of my
family, <i>that</i> I would string them together, and so swell
the work alluded to.&nbsp; To do this I thought it necessary to
affix a short heading to each, to particularize <!-- page 8--><a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>the writer, and
for this purpose wrote, to head my brother&rsquo;s, a short
biographical sketch of him, consisting of about thirty lines, and
quitting my house, left it on my way to chambers at my printers,
returned home, the labours of the day over,&mdash;went to bed,
but not to sleep, thought of my late brother, of that I had
written of him, pondered over the past anecdotes of his life,
that had been often told me, recalled his image to my memory, and
amidst airy visions of the past, of my father, earlier days, and
of youthful pleasures mixed with pain, fell asleep&mdash;<span
class="smcap">but</span>&mdash;with a determination.&nbsp; To
carry it out,&mdash;on the morrow I began this sketch.&nbsp; You
must judge how I have performed my self-imposed task, and wishing
it may amuse you, and encourage young aspirants who shall chance
to read it, not to give way under difficulties, but strenuously
to persevere, seeing how much may be achieved by diligence and a
determination not to yield, remembering ever the good advice and
the useful maxim delivered of old:&mdash;</p>

9</span>LIFE OF HENRY COOPER.</h2>
<p>The subject of the present memoir, Henry Cooper, was born at a
house in Bethel Street, in the City of Norwich, now well-known as
the late residence of Alderman Hawkes, and where resided for many
years his father, Charles, now better known as Old Counsellor
Cooper, a remarkable man, who, like the late William Cobbett,
though of humble origin, possessed one of those minds that will
and must, as they have ever done from the time of Deioces of
Ecbatana (recorded by Herodotus) till now, elevate the possessor
and compel the homage, whilst exciting the no small envy of
inferior intellects.&nbsp; What education he received was at a
small school kept by the Rev. John Bruckner (a Lutheran Divine),
who died in 1804, and was buried at Guist, in Norfolk, where
French, Latin, and the common rudiments of an English education
were taught; and where, too, the late William
Taylor,&mdash;perhaps one of the most extraordinary men Norwich
ever produced, the early and intimate friend of Southey, and who
was the first, according to Lockhart&rsquo;s Life of Scott, to
give that great writer a taste for poetry by his (Taylor&rsquo;s)
spirited and inimitable translation of B&uuml;rger&rsquo;s well
known ballad beginning,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;At break of day from frightful dreams up
started Eleanor,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>was his fellow pupil, and who has told me what a gentle,
industrious, and amiable boy he remembered my father <!-- page
10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>(truly, in this instance, the child was father of the
man); there he acquired, no doubt, some knowledge, but it was far
more to his own self-instruction that he was indebted for the
large and varied knowledge he possessed, for, as his brother
Samuel (his only and younger brother,&mdash;he had a sister but
she died young) informed my mother that such was his early thirst
for knowledge, that he not only repudiated all play, and the
sports of boyhood, taught himself Greek, and greedily devoured
the contents of every book that came within his reach, but would,
with the pocket-money given him, purchase candles, and when the
family had retired to rest, light one, and sit and read till the
dawn of day, when he would creep into bed, and sleep till the
hour of call, when he would rise to resume anew his mental
exercise.&nbsp; So years past by, and the young and sickly
looking boy grew into the youth, when his father, a man of strong
intellect, with a great deal of sound common sense, perceiving
the bent of his son&rsquo;s mind,&mdash;and being a man who had
retired early in life from business with a small property, on
which he lived in a house at Heigham (a hamlet within the
city),&mdash;at once placed his son Charles with one of the most
respectable attornies, in large business in Norwich, as an
articled clerk to the law, where he very soon, by his persevering
industry, his assiduity, and the great acuteness shown in every
matter entrusted to his care and management, so conciliated the
good opinion of his master, who discovered progressively, the
evident marks of superior abilities [here, too, he indulged to an
excess his insatiable thirst for reading, that he would sit up
the greater part of the night for this purpose, to the neglect
and <!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>injury of his health], that at the termination of his
engagement, his conduct was so acceptable, and his services so
manifest, and his influence, too, among the clients, was found to
be so extensive, that on his obtaining his certificate to
practise as an attorney, his principal was glad to offer him a
share in the business, and receive him as a partner; the
reputation he had already acquired became wide spread, and
quickly raised the firm in the estimation of the public, and
clients flocked to it, and all would see, if they could, and
consult with Mr. Cooper on their affairs.</p>
<p>Some years thus passed, when, from some cause or other, a
dissolution took place in the partnership, and when, probably
from the advice of friends stimulated by his wife&rsquo;s
ambition (a Miss Yarrington, a woman as I have been given to
understand, of masculine mind, vast energy, and indomitable
spirit, whom her son Henry has been often said by those who knew
her, to have resembled in more than features, for in face he
resembled his mother), he was induced to enter himself at
Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn, which he accordingly did in the year 1782,
and is thus entered: &ldquo;Charles Cooper, of the City of
Norwich, eldest son of Charles Cooper of the same place,
merchant, admitted 22nd of April, 1782.&rdquo;&nbsp; Prior to
this, a remarkable incident occurred in his life: he undertook
the conduct of a cause of great intricacy and importance for a
pauper, a labouring blacksmith.&nbsp; An extensive and valuable
landed property, well-known as Oby Hall, with its extensive
demesnes, had been for a long time in abeyance; the property was
estimated at that period, at not less than &pound;30,000; on
failure of male issue, the descendants on the female side put in
their claim, among whom the blacksmith stood foremost; <!-- page
12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>he
came, consulted with my father on his claim, who became after a
time, convinced of the solidity of his title; and after examining
it with indefatigable assiduity, he at length, after much
entreaty, undertook to carry his cause through every court, were
it necessary, upon certain conditions; the conditions were, that
if my father succeeded in gaining the cause, in consideration of
taking upon himself all the risk, expenses, and labour, he should
enjoy the estate; whilst the claimant, having no relations but
the most distant, if any, was to receive an annuity for life of
&pound;300.&nbsp; After almost insurmountable difficulties, great
expense, and consumption of time and labour, the long anticipated
time arrived when the trial was to decide the question of such
grave moment to the parties concerned: Lord Erskine came down to
Norwich specially retained for the claimant (the origin, I
believe of his after intimacy with Henry), the case came on for
trial,&mdash;was fought on both sides with all the ability and
ingenuity such a cause demanded (I forget the name of the
opposing counsel), the claimant&rsquo;s title was confirmed, and
the estate gained.&nbsp; The claimant lived but a little more
than a year or two after to receive his annuity, to him absolute
wealth; and he died, I have heard, expressing to the last, his
gratitude to (as he styled my father) his protector.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, coming into the possession of the estate, my
father must turn farmer, and like him, I have before compared him
to, and I have often thought since reading the works of Cobbett,
that there was a similarity in their thoughts on many subjects;
he soon began to farm at a fearful loss (for to be a gainful
farmer, so farmers hold, or rather they did then, a man should
properly be trained to it from his youth), he <!-- page 13--><a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>was forced to
trust to others to do what he should himself have done, and being
still occupied in his professional pursuits at Norwich, his
visits to the hall and the estate were but occasional, and the
eye of the master was but too often absent; his family, however,
resided there, consisting of his wife and his four children,
Charles, Henry, Harriet, and Alfred, and there his affections
were centred, so that it cannot be wondered at, that with a
divided duty, and the course pursued, ere many years, but I am
forestalling, the estate soon became involved, and eventually he
was compelled to part with it at a loss, or rather with no gain,
for at the time of its sale, which happened at a period during
the long war, land fell all of a sudden greatly in value, and the
seller was glad to experience the truth of the old
saying&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When house and land and all are spent,<br
/>
Then learning is most excellent.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sale, however, did not occur till some years after the
death of his first wife, and when he had married his second, a
Miss Rose White, my mother, and by whom he had several children,
seven only living to maturity, all of whom, I being the eldest,
having survived him.&nbsp; His first family, with the exception
of his daughter, who died a few years ago, having all died
previous to the decease of their father.&nbsp; After having
pursued his studies with his accustomed assiduity, in chambers he
had taken in Stone Buildings, and eaten his terms, he was called
to the bar on the 9th of June, in the year 1788.&nbsp; (For these
several dates I am indebted to the kindness of Mr. Doyle, the
greatly respected steward of Lincoln&rsquo;s <!-- page 14--><a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>Inn.)&nbsp;
When, having resided a few terms in London, he hastily left the
metropolis&mdash;the true and only sphere for the full
development of extensive legal knowledge and great abilities,
such as his,&mdash;to reside and practise as a provincial
barrister in his native city; where, from his previous
reputation, not only as a lawyer well versed in common law, with
great knowledge in the practical parts of it, but as a most
skilful conveyancer, and great real property lawyer, with a deep
knowledge of all its intricacies and moot points, he, at once,
obtained considerable practice, and a fine income, which, I
believe, by present provincial counsel would be regarded rather
as a fiction than reality.&nbsp; He was, moreover, a fluent
speaker, with diction pure, and most grammatical.&nbsp; I ought,
here, perhaps, to mention what will seem strange to the present
generation, that I have often heard my father say, that the first
book he began to study law from was &ldquo;Wood&rsquo;s
Institutes,&rdquo; a book that &ldquo;the Commentaries of
Blackstone,&rdquo; rendering the study of the law far more
intelligible and easy to the student, has long completely
superseded.&nbsp; In Norwich he continued to reside up to his
death, where he was ever applied to by every attorney, without
exception, far and near, if any very difficult point of law
arose; and, till within some few years prior to his death, which
happened on the 21st of July, 1836, when age as, is usual, though
it kindly spared the vigour of his intellect, yet brought with it
its physical weakness and ailments, he was employed as leading
counsel in many important causes, where legal knowledge and
acumen was required; and, in the courts, from the high reputation
he had acquired, he ever commanded the ear of the judges, and the
respect of his brethren at the bar.&nbsp; <!-- page 15--><a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>He had the
joy, too, to live to see his son Henry rising fast to eminence in
the same profession, though the after pang and anguish to sorrow
for his death; and he grieved for him in heart, though not his
youngest, as did Jacob at the imagined loss of his favourite,
and, in my opinion, never did he quite get over it; he not only
loved, but was proud of him.</p>
<p>The latter years of him, whose life I have thus briefly
sketched, were past at his small country residence, situated at
Lakenham, where his second wife, who survived him, my mother, now
seventy-four, still resides, a hamlet of and situate two miles
from Norwich, where he spent the chief of his time, of that he
could spare from the city where he practised, till up to the last
twelve months of his life, when in his eighty-fourth year he
expired, worn out with past exertion and years, and was, as chief
Coroner and Magistrate of the Close and its precincts, under the
jurisdiction of the Dean and Chapter, buried within the cloisters
of the cathedral.</p>
<p>By his family, from his sweetness of disposition, kindness of
heart, and amiability of temper, he was tenderly beloved and
regretted, and still whenever recalled to memory in the quietude
of the chamber the eye will ever be moistened by a tear, and the
heart kindle at the recollection; and by many others he was and
will be yet greatly missed; the poor and struggling literary man
he would encourage not only with praise, but with his purse, and,
<span class="smcap">that</span>, the poor and needy had ever open
to them, and his advice besides gratuitously, whenever required
(and this might be confirmed by hundreds still living &ldquo;in
the <span class="smcap">once</span> ancient city,&rdquo; as a
certain wise Alderman of yore styled it), and to their affairs he
would give as much attention as to the richest client; his
private memoranda alone, after <!-- page 16--><a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>death, told
his good deeds, for he strictly adhered to the beautiful doctrine
laid down by the great Teacher, &ldquo;But when thou doest alms,
let not thy left hand know what thy right hand
doeth,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Quando ullum invenies
parem</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of his first family, Charles, the eldest son, was intended for
the bar, and was entered at Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn, but from the
natural sensitiveness of his disposition he never kept his terms,
and soon gave up all thoughts of the profession; he lingered at
home, a Westminster scholar, a man of extensive reading, and of
great intelligence [as I have been informed, for I was much too
young fully to appreciate him], till after many years, on
Henry&rsquo;s quitting Bermudas, he became the secretary to Sir
James Cockburn, in which employment he continued some years, and
only returned when Sir James ceased to be the governor.&nbsp; He
then became a kind of superior clerk in the Marine office then
held in Spring Gardens, and subsequently died at the age of about
forty-five or forty-eight of consumption, a complaint of the
mother&rsquo;s family.&nbsp; Alfred went into the army as an
ensign, was at the battle of Waterloo, was wounded there, was
ordered and went subsequently to India with his regiment, the
14th Foot, where, years after, just as he had obtained a sick
leave to return home, he was shot at Dinapoor, whilst reposing on
his sofa, thinking probably, or dreaming of home and its
affections, by a drunken Sepoy, mistaking him (in his mad
excitement) for his servant, who had just previously refused him
drink; the occurrence caused, necessarily, great excitement and
much conversation at the time, the man was caught and
hanged&mdash;a satisfaction to justice, but a wretched
consolation to his family, by whom, as the youngest, and amiable
as he was gentle, he was most fondly loved.&nbsp; His father and
sister, I <!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>believe, were never made acquainted
with the true cause of his death.&nbsp; A letter of Henry&rsquo;s
relating, though indistinctly, for evident reasons, to the sad
occurrence, will be placed before the reader.&nbsp; Harriet, as I
have said, the only sister (who married a Dr. Leath, a physician
in the army, who resides still at Bayswater) died not very long
ago, leaving no issue.</p>
<p>Having given a sketch, which I think and hope will have
interested the reader of him, from whom He sprung, whose life I
am about to delineate.&nbsp; I will now proceed to depict the
life of the Son, with the simple remark that I have undertaken a
task of no slight difficulty (and much such an one as that of the
poor Jews, who, under their hard taskmasters in Egypt, were set
to make bricks without straw), with very slight materials to
describe the life of one who died when I was sixteen, and whom I
loved from his unvaried kindness to me, of the life of one who,
had he lived, would have had a far abler biographer.&nbsp; Henry,
in early life, took a propensity to and entered the navy, and was
a midshipman in the battle of the Nile, but soon after, disliking
the service, quitted the profession.</p>
<p>His education, when he returned from sea, was, through
indulgence, neglected: and he passed most of his time at Oby
Hall, in Norfolk, the then residence of his father, and distant
about eight miles from Yarmouth, in shooting, fishing, and
driving a tandem-cart about the country, built of unusual height;
and an anecdote is related of him, that, after driving it awhile,
he went to Mr. Clements, the builder at Norwich, and said,
&ldquo;Well, Clements, you have built a machine to surprise all
the world, and I am come to surprise you by paying you for
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; And to show his early quick perception, ready
reply, wilfulness, and <!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>precocity, I must here relate two
well-attested anecdotes: the first, when quite a child, and at
his lessons in the nursery, on his mother&rsquo;s running up to
dispel the noise and disturbance he was making, she exclaimed in
anger, after in some measure correcting him, &ldquo;Why, sir, if
you go on in this manner you&rsquo;ll turn the house out of the
windows,&rdquo; the young gentleman, looking roguishly at his
mother, responded, &ldquo;How can I do that, Ma, for the house is
bigger than the windows?&rdquo; this of course dissipated all
anger, and brought a smile to the mother&rsquo;s face; silence,
however, was restored and study resumed.&nbsp; The other, when he
was about eleven or twelve years of age, a poor soldier, who had
been kind to him, assisting him in his fishing, boating, &amp;c.,
and who was at that time cleaning harness for my brother in the
stable, was arrested by an escort of soldiers, who suddenly came
to apprehend and convey him, for some alleged offence, to the
head quarters at Yarmouth; without saying a word or leaving a
message behind him, young Henry started off with his friend and
the soldiers, telling the captive, &ldquo;Never to care, for he
would be his advocate.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was, after some time had
elapsed, missed; search was made for him in every direction till
night came on, but no traces of his whereabouts could be
discovered, and, with fearful anxiety, as I have heard my father
often say, all, at last, worn out and weary with the fruitless
search, retired to bed, but not to rest; care brooded over their
pillows and dispelled sleep.&nbsp; Morning, at last, came, but
with it no tidings of Henry; and, when alarm had reached its
height, in ran the servant lad, in breathless haste, exclaiming,
&ldquo;Master Henry is found,&rdquo; and soon after he was seen,
being borne in triumph on a soldier&rsquo;s back, with others
following, coming up the lawn.&nbsp; All were delighted to see
<!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>the lost one safe, and, to delight was added
astonishment, on a soldier putting into his father&rsquo;s hand a
letter, which was quickly opened and read, and which came from
the commanding officer.&nbsp; I regret that letter is lost; it
spoke, I have often heard my father and mother relate, in the
highest terms of the youngster, and warmly congratulating the
former on the possession of such a son, so noble in bearing, so
bold, and so talented; adding, that he had pleaded the
soldier&rsquo;s case so well, that he had, so young an advocate
as he was, obtained the acquittal of his client.&nbsp; As he grew
up in years he was the pride and terror of the little farmers of
the neighbourhood,&mdash;the first from his ready wit, playful,
and genial disposition, which he ever retained; the latter from
the practical jokes he was constantly in the habit of playing on
them, many of which are remembered and spoken of at, and around
Oby, up to the present day: and he had the love of all, for, if
they wanted game, or any kindness done them, they had only to ask
and have.&nbsp; But midst this he read, and he lacked not mental
food to feed on, as his father possessed a large and well-stocked
library.&nbsp; Henry&rsquo;s reading, however, was necessarily
desultory and discursive, but such the retention of his memory,
that he forgot nothing he had once conned; as an instance of this
I must relate an anecdote, often told of him by Mr. Jay, an
attorney at Norwich, still living, and who was an excellent
client, and a great admirer of my brother, that soon after large
business flowed in upon him, and he went into court with a bag
full of briefs; to his Mr. Jay&rsquo;s utter astonishment, after
a case had been called on, in which he was the attorney, and the
several witnesses had been called, examined, and the cause
gained, my brother, who had <!-- page 20--><a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>led it,
turned round, and said, &ldquo;There Jay, I have won your cause,
but I will be hanged if I know where your brief is; I read it,
but somehow lost it.&rdquo;&nbsp; He, of course, used blank paper
for his notes.&nbsp; His perception, too, was so acute, his
imagination so vivid, and his memory so retentive, that he could
at once, and readily apply the knowledge so widely gleaned to the
subject under discussion, that they who were ignorant of his
previous mental instruction, would have imagined that he had, in
earlier years, been the lean and diligent student, who had wasted
the midnight oil in meditation and deep research.</p>
<p>After an interval of years, he became a member of
Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn, when in due course of time he was proposed
by the late Mr. Justice, then James Allan Parke, Esquire, and
called to the bar, May 25th, 1811.&nbsp; Soon after his call, he
accompanied Sir James Cockburn, who had been just appointed
governor of the Bermudas, as his secretary, and after a short
period, on his arrival there, was made Attorney General, the
duties of which office he for some years performed to the entire
satisfaction of the governor.&nbsp; His letters thence, I have
understood, contained beautiful and vivid descriptions of</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;That happy island where huge lemons
grow&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[he was an admirer of scenery and nature], and that the wit,
graphic portraitures of the men in office on the island, the
general chit chat, scandle and fun, intermixed with politics,
occasional rhymes, &amp;c., put the reader [since dead] of a few
of them, in mind of the letters of Lord Byron.&nbsp; After his
return home, he took chambers in Fig Tree or Elm Court, in the
Temple, read and awaited clients, and went the Norfolk circuit;
but, alas! few profitable knocks came to his <!-- page 21--><a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>door, and the
circuit yielded rather expense than profit; but on he went
struggling and struggling, till at last his talents were
acknowledged; and the four years preceding his death, he was an
eminent leader, and engaged in almost every cause throughout his
circuit, and rapidly gaining a reputation in London from
&ldquo;the very eloquent, bold, and honest style of his
defence,&rdquo; for Mary Ann Carlile, who was prosecuted, by what
was then styled the Constitutional Association, for publishing a
libel upon the government, and the constitution of this
country.&nbsp; The trial ended after a brilliant speech of the
defendant&rsquo;s counsel, full of argument, eloquence, and
ability, in the dismissal of the jury, after being locked up all
night; the counsel for the prosecution, the late Mr. Baron
Gurney, consenting to their discharge.&nbsp; The report of the
trial, and Henry Cooper&rsquo;s speech in full, was printed and
published by the notorious Richard Carlile, who then kept a shop
in Fleet Street.&nbsp; At the early age of forty my brother died,
and he was then looked on by the profession, as a man, who, had
he lived, must have achieved the highest honours in it.&nbsp; He
was an ardent admirer of, and some of his friends were pleased to
say, a close imitator of the oratory of Lord Erskine, with whom,
till he died, he was on terms of the greatest intimacy.&nbsp; In
fact he was writing his life for publication, by the express
desire of Erskine himself, when death staid the pen.&nbsp; Alas!
but a few pages of it were written, and those in the rough, I
will, however, lay them, ere I have done, before the reader.</p>
<p>Henry, the last four years of his going circuit, and when his
abilities were acknowledged, was sometimes opposed to his father,
to the no small pleasure and amusement of the Norwich people, who
as greatly <!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>respected the legal ability of the
one, as they admired the eloquence of the other; and it was often
a source of half suppressed laughter in that portion of the court
set aside for the public to hear &ldquo;my learned friend&rdquo;
banded from one to the other by the two Athlete&mdash;Father and
Son&mdash;the one as powerful from his tact, energy, and fervid
eloquence, as the other from his legal knowledge and great
acumen, and who was often the victor, for that knowledge, deep
and extensive gave the father a superiority on those points of a
case, in which law and fact were intermingled, and which were apt
from Henry&rsquo;s comparative previous little business and short
practice as a leader to escape his attention, or when patent
rendered him less capable effectually to grapple with the legal
and knotty difficulty, for he had never had the advantage of a
pleader&rsquo;s chambers; nor let it be thought in those days
that there were no giants to contend with&mdash;Sergeants
Blosset, Frere, and Storks, Messrs. Plumptre, Eagle, Robinson,
Prime, and others of note, with Biggs Andrews, now Q.C., and
George Raymond, author of the &ldquo;Elliston Papers,&rdquo; as
juniors were on the circuit, all of whom have long since been
dead, with the exception of Mr. Sergeant Storks and the four last
named.</p>
<p>And here I cannot do better than insert a paragraph signed J.
S., which appeared in the <i>Times</i>, I think in or about the
years 1831 or 1832; I copy from the paragraph cut out from the
paper, and at the time pasted in an album, to which the date was
omitted to be attached.&nbsp; The paragraph was headed,
&ldquo;The late Henry Cooper:&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;To most of our legal readers, we feel
convinced, that this week&rsquo;s sketch of the late <!-- page
23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>Henry
Cooper, the friend companion and intended biographer of the late
Lord Erskine, will prove highly acceptable.&nbsp; The unexpected
and melancholy event which deprived the bar of one of its most
promising ornaments, and cast a shade over the gay and talented
circle in which he moved, must be fresh within the memory of our
readers.&nbsp; As yet no memoir, no frail tribute to stamp even a
fleeting remembrance of his learning, professional fame, or
liberal principles has appeared, and while worthless rank and
heartlessness have been perpetuated by marble and the prostituted
energies of literature, genius, talent, and honor, have been left
to the obscurity of the grave; not one of those who shared his
gay and mirthful hours, who listened enraptured to his eloquence
and flashes of wit, which as Hamlet says &lsquo;were won&rsquo;t
to set the table in a roar,&rsquo; have endeavoured by giving to
the world his literary labours, or even a sketch of his life, to
preserve his memory from oblivion.&nbsp; Henry Cooper was the son
of an eminent counsellor of Norwich, a gentleman of powerful
mind, whose legal knowledge has rendered him one of the first
consulting men of the day.&nbsp; Even at his present advanced age
of near eighty, he may be seen early of a morning taking his
accustomed walk, or if the weather be too severe for exercise,
found in his library surrounded by his books and papers.</p>
<p>Raised by his own perseverance, and in a great measure
self-educated, it is not to be wondered at if from such a father,
the subject of our sketch, acquired those habits of perseverance
and industry which enabled him by system to attain knowledge and
fame in his profession.</p>
<p><!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>Upon being called to the bar his convivial powers and
talent for conversation introduced him to Erskine, who found so
much pleasure in his society, that they became not mere friends,
but inseparable companions, and plunged together in the gay round
of pleasure, which the world too temptingly presents to men whose
minds enable them to watch its interests and guide the machine by
which society is regulated.&nbsp; To all who knew him, and the
thoughtless life he led, it was a matter of surprise how and when
he found time to attend to the numerous cases of his clients, for
his field of action soon became extended; yet we will venture to
pronounce and feel confident of being borne out by those who knew
him, that in no one instance did the cause of the party he
advocated suffer.</p>
<p>In the Court he appeared as well acquainted with the words of
his brief, as if it had been for months the object of his most
serious attention; not a thread or a link of evidence escaped
him, and so persuasive was his manner, so argumentive his style
of language, that the jury frequently received the impressions he
wished to convey, and their feelings generally, if not their
judgment, went in favour of his client.&nbsp; He used, on some
occasions, to plead in the Norfolk Courts, and we have frequently
seen him opposed to his father as a special pleader.&nbsp; The
old gentlemen, strong in the possession of his youthful
intellect, which time even to the present hour has failed to rob
him of, was perhaps less assailable by his pleasing manner and
florid speech than any of his brothers of the bar, and his
ejaculations not always of the most complimentary nature, were
sometimes loud and frequent.&nbsp; We have seen the son on such
occasions always the first to smile <!-- page 25--><a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>at his
father&rsquo;s petulance, and the last to express any sense of
the impropriety of the interruption.&nbsp; We have seen the old
gentleman, in the midst of his son&rsquo;s argument, write to the
opposing counsel suggesting authorities and giving references and
precedents against him, all with the most perfect good humour on
both sides; and the greatest triumph he could boast was to defeat
his son upon a point of law: on such occasions he would put his
hands behind his back, and moving round with a chuckle, exclaim,
&ldquo;Something to learn yet, Harry!&rdquo;&nbsp; The
father&rsquo;s delight and pride in his superior legal knowledge
over his son, became at last a standing joke with the barristers
of the Court.&nbsp; The death of Lord Erskine blighted Henry
Cooper&rsquo;s hopes to a seat in Parliament, where his eloquence
and sarcasm would have made him powerful as an ally, and feared
as an antagonist; liberal in his opinions to the present
exclusive system of the church, he was a decided enemy, and a
thorough reformer in the state.&nbsp; His services at a crisis
like the present, would have been of incalculable benefit to his
country.</p>
<p>From the period of the loss of his friend, till his own
untimely end, he devoted himself more than he had ever before, to
literary pursuits and the labours of his profession.&nbsp; A life
of Lord Erskine was nearly arranged for the press at the time of
his decease, and it is to be regretted that as yet his labours
have not been given, imperfect as they are, to the world; no one
could have had better opportunities or have been better
calculated for the task; alike the counsellor in his
difficulties, the companion of his mirthful hours, the springs of
action, the feelings of his breast, must have appeared unveiled
before him; Death, however, prevented the completion of his task
and removed him too early from the world his talents
ornamented.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>I had forgotten to say, that on his return from Bermudas
he became and continued very intimate with the Cockburn family,
and often prophesied the future success of the late Attorney
General, now Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas, then
young Alexander Cockburn; and often has my brother said to me,
then about sixteen, when speaking of the above family,
&ldquo;rely upon it, Billy, young Alexander, if he enter the
profession, will do great things in it; he is a remarkably
clever, energetic, and talented young man.&rdquo;&nbsp; Henry had
much of the restlessness and irritability, the usual
accompaniments of a high order of talent, with great earnestness
in diction and action.</p>
<p>Ere I proceed further; the reader will, perhaps, be pleased
with a likeness of the man.&nbsp; I should say, in height, he was
about five-feet eleven-inches; of spare and sinewy frame, with an
elastic tread, that those who knew him, and seeing him in the
distance, might truly say, as Ulysses of Diomede in
Shakspeare&rsquo;s play of &ldquo;Troilus and
Cressida,&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis he, I ken the manner of his
gait;<br />
That spirit of his in aspiration lifts him from the
earth.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And often have I heard the late Mr. Alderson (the father of
the present judge), who travelled with my father, circuit and
sessions as a provincial barrister, more than thirty years, and
who was resident at Norwich, say,&mdash;&ldquo;that Henry always
put him more in mind of a Spirit, that a man of flesh and
blood;&rdquo; his eye dark, like that of Edmund Kean&rsquo;s, the
great actor, showed every emotion of the soul, now fiery with
anger, now glazed with thought, and anon, melting into softness;
his head small, and finely rounded, and covered with thick
clustering curls of black crispy hair, was such as sculptors have
ever loved to give the youthful Antinous; <!-- page 27--><a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>his forehead
retreating was characteristic, as Lavater says, &ldquo;of
genius;&rdquo; his nose was slightly arched in the centre and
slightly fleshy near the nostrils; his face oval, with a well
defined chin and a mouth plain, but full of energy and
expression, and similar to Sterne&rsquo;s, the contour, of whose
face I always thought my brother&rsquo;s much resembled.&nbsp; I
have thus given, to please the lover of physiognomy, &ldquo;a
shadow portrait,&rdquo; not &ldquo;a Myall&rsquo;s
photograph,&rdquo; which I hope will not only satisfy the
physiognomist, but which I think they, who but even slightly
remember Henry Cooper, have but to place before the tablet of
their memory and view the shade cast from it with their
&ldquo;mind&rsquo;s eye&rdquo; to at once recall and recognize
the original.&nbsp; I have thus sketched his likeness, as I
regret to say, thus only can he be now known, or viewed by those
who were unacquainted with him living, as no portrait of him is
extant, he dying young, and for years previous struggling to
succeed in a profession where the &ldquo;battle is not always to
the strong,&rdquo; though in the long run the best man often
succeeds, as with few exceptions, perhaps, the long race, barring
accidents, is usually won by the best horse.&nbsp; He left no
writings behind him save a few letters, beautifully expressed,
but mostly relating to family matters, and, therefore,
uninteresting to the general reader, with the exception of five
or six preserved by my mother, which I will give the reader ere I
have ended this biographical sketch; and the few friends with
whom he corresponded, and to whom, occasionally, he showed, and
gave the productions of his pen, though they considered him a man
of considerable talent, set such small value on his effusions,
that, however, pleased at the time they might have been with them
<!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>they were put aside forgotten and most probably
destroyed, and what he himself chanced to write and was pleased
with for the instant, was, from the natural carelessness of his
disposition, hastily cast aside, and, no doubt, often burnt with
the waste paper of his chambers; so that every endeavour I have
made to possess even a shred of these scraps, has been
futile.&nbsp; All I have been able to gather are the few letters
alluded to, with a few poetical lines which will be given to the
reader; and, as we often judge of character from trifles, he
must, from the slight sketch I have given, and the small crumbs I
have been able to collect, form a judgment of <span
class="smcap">him</span> I have endeavoured to describe.&nbsp; He
had all but reached the height of his profession, when he was
taken away, no doubt for a wise purpose, to the deep and lasting
regret of those who not only fondly loved him, but who had begun
to take, and no wonder, a warm pride in the object of their
affections.</p>
<p>He died on September 19th, 1824, having been attacked some
days previous by a severe attack of diarrh&oelig;a, which, by
some fatal mischance, was mistaken by the surgeons who attended
him, for brain fever; he was, consequently, bled, and drastic
medicines were administered, which must have hastened if they did
not cause his death, which happened at the house of a friend of
his, by the name of Hill, at Chelsea, where he was buried, but
his body was afterwards removed by his sister and deposited where
it now lies, near his father&rsquo;s in the cloisters of Norwich
Cathedral.</p>
<p>I will now lay before the reader the few letters I
possess.&nbsp; By the letters of an ingenuous writer, it is said,
you can gain a clearer insight into his character, disposition,
and mental powers, than by long association or familiar <!-- page
29--><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>discourse; these letters have been kindly given me by my
mother, with whom Henry constantly corresponded, and whom he
always treated with marked respect and affection, which was fully
reciprocated.&nbsp; They were addressed to her at Norwich, where
she with my father resided, and the first bears date,</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right"><i>London</i>,
3<i>rd</i> <i>Nov.</i> 1815.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Dear Madam,</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it came to pass that when they emptied their sacks,
lo! ev&rsquo;ry man&rsquo;s money was in the mouth of his
sack.&rdquo;&nbsp; I have had the same measure from you which
Joseph&rsquo;s liberality heaped on his brethren; and if you will
but believe that my proposal to you, to be allowed to be a
purchaser of half the preserved raspberry, was not a covert mode
of begging it as a gift; I thank you without any regret, and am
very much obliged to you.&nbsp; I thank you, too, very much for
the pheasant which flew into the window of the mail coach, and
startled me in St. Stephen&rsquo;s Street.&nbsp; George, who is a
good lad, had put on his best legs, and soon overtaking the mail,
threw it in &lsquo;<i>sans ceremonie</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was a
pleasant disturbance from no very pleasant reverie, which my mind
set out on the moment the coach set out from the inn; and which
would, but for this agreeable interruption, have lasted me at
least as long as the first stage.&nbsp; For the rest of the good
things which you gave me while I was in Norwich, and sent me
laden away with, I must thank you <i>en masse</i>; for to thank
you one by one for them, would force me to write a long letter,
which I have not the least intention in the world of doing.&nbsp;
I was outside the mail, and for a long way the only
passenger.&nbsp; We learned at Newmarket, that the coachman, who
drove the coach, which was overturned the preceding night, lay
very much hurt.&nbsp; <!-- page 30--><a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>His viscera are bruised, and his only
chance of life is in cool veins well emptied by the lancet.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis right that he on whose care the safety of others
depends should be most prominently exposed to the danger of ill
conduct or neglect; I wish heartily that this liability could be
transferred from those who sit on the coach box, to those who sit
in the cabinet and hold the reins of the hard driven state! we
should then have had more peace and less taxes.&nbsp; Ask Mr.
Samuel Cooper [a great liberal and brother of my father] if we
should not?</p>
<p>At Chesterford your friend, Mr. Smith, the representative for
Norwich, took the mail; and after a nap, talked very
unrestrainedly with me on the present state of France, on
Buonaparte, the criminal law, and the wisdom of the Justices at
sessions.&nbsp; I was determined&mdash;like Horace&rsquo;s
whetstone, which can sharpen other things, though blunt itself,
to put an edge on him&mdash;to say something deep and decisive on
some of the subjects, but I got nothing from him but working-day
talk.&nbsp; Perhaps (like the character with the Greek name in
the <i>Rambler</i>, who tells his guest, showing him his fine
things, that they were only brought into service when persons of
consequence visited him) he disdained to pull out his best to me,
yet I rather judge that he is only clever to the party at
Norwich; and as Oberon, though but six inches high, is yet tall
for a fairy, he is a great Apollo to the blue and whites [the
colours of the liberal party at Norwich].&nbsp; For corroboration
of any opinion of theirs, I should always, like the Recorder of
London, think it right to ask the cook.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s my letter, a type of the miracle of the creation
and the lie to the great Epicurean maxim, that &lsquo;Nothing can
be made out of nothing;&rsquo; for as one of those, that, as the
song runs, &lsquo;None can love like,&rsquo; would exclaim, <!--
page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>&lsquo;by Jasus, I had not a word to say, and yet I have
spoke three whole pages!&rsquo;</p>
<p>My duty to my father, and if you please, my best regards to
Mrs. Watson [my mother&rsquo;s sister], on condition she has no
more hysterics; and that is, as she pleases, more than perhaps
she is aware of.&nbsp; She is not naturally melancholy, and may
soon accustom her mind to like hope better than
remembrance.&nbsp; My best love to Harriet [his sister], I
should, as I promised her, have written to her if I had not
written to you, but one letter will serve both; pray assure her
how grateful I am to her for all her anxious care and attention
to me; I will not even allow that Charles [his eldest brother,
who was then the secretary to Sir James Cockburn at Bermudas]
loves her more than I, or esteems her more, or will be more glad
(as I told him in my letter) than I was to see that she was
better in health than she had been for years; &rsquo;twill make
him happy indeed, for the possibility of losing her is alarming
to him, and if she were to die, he would be most inconsolable;
yet his grief would not be more than mine, nor would he be more
ready to exclaim,&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I, nunc; et, numina non posse nega&rsquo;</p>
<p>which, as you are a lady, I translate for you, &lsquo;go now
and say, that angels cannot die.&rsquo;&nbsp; But you must not
read this to her, for she will absurdly say &rsquo;tis flattery,
as if I could have any motive to flatter her.</p>
<p>My love to Will [meaning myself].&nbsp; He is so much improved
as to be an engaging boy, and I begin to like him very much.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">I am, dear Madam,<br />
Yours very faithfully,<br />
HENRY COOPER.</p>
<p><!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>P.S.&mdash;If Mr. Boardman [an old friend of his] should
call, pray remember me most particularly to him.&nbsp; He has
long behaved to me with the affection of a brother.&nbsp; He has
even, in no few instances, preferred my interests to his
own.&nbsp; I am most deeply obliged to him, and I like to tell
people of it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next letter bears date,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right"><i>London</i>,
31<i>st</i> <i>Dec.</i> 1815.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To the same,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I send you the only coin I have, my very
warm thanks for one of the finest and best turkeys that entered
the metropolis to be devoured in celebration and honour of
Christmas.&nbsp; A Christian of the utmost degree of faith, that
is as great as you ladies place in physicians, who devoured with
a devout and religious pique, could not have eaten more or with
more pleasure than I, though I sat down with no other zeal than
an hungry appetite, and little better than a mere heathen
stomach.&nbsp; When I reflected that you good people at Norwich
were rioting on just such a dinner (upon my honour), I could not
help blushing for your preposterous consciences, that, could
expect to enjoy so much pleasure in this world, and be saved in
the next too.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis well for me that no one offered to
bet with me, that the pheasants did not come from you; but, I
pray, do not think of returning me the thanks, which I paid for
them.&nbsp; They are all due, and a vast sum more on the old
account, though you, like a liberal creditor, may have no idea of
urging the payment of the balance against me, and I beg they may
be carried to it.&nbsp; I had almost forgotten to add
Alfred&rsquo;s thanks to mine for the turkey [he was the youngest
brother, who was an ensign in the 14th Foot, and had been wounded
in the recent battle].&nbsp; He was here in time, and made <!--
page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>a dinner that contrasts rather vividly with his first
meal after the battle of Waterloo, on a slice of old cow that
they shot with their muskets, and tore to pieces, without giving
themselves a moment&rsquo;s pause to reflect whether the
Bramin&rsquo;s might not be the true religion.&nbsp; But I must
not anticipate any part of his narrative to you, and Harriet, as
to another Dido and Anna, of all he has seen, done, and suffered,
throughout which he has been, like the French poets (Grissets)
famous parrot, <i>quite as unfortunate</i> as &AElig;neas, and a
great deal more pious.&nbsp; In other respects, indeed,
you&rsquo;ll not find him like that bird; he&rsquo;ll not give
you his adventures with the gratuitous loquacity of poor
Poll.&nbsp; In this he&rsquo;d rather resemble the bullfinch; you
must give out the tune to him, and chirrup with questions to him
before he will pipe his strain to you; and when I consider the
vast difficulty which the natural taciturnity of you ladies
places you under of asking questions, I feel for your curiosity
in its tight stays excessively.&nbsp; On this occasion, perhaps,
where the motive is so strong, you will break through your native
restraint; and, therefore, I advise you to have your
interrogatories ready by the 8th of January, 1816, when Alfred,
who means to accompany me, will be in Norwich.&nbsp; I am very
grateful to you for your benevolent wishes of prosperity and
happiness to me, but they fall on a heart dead to
expectation.&nbsp; I have been so long in obscurity, that hope
has quite left off visiting me; the best years of my life are
gone; and what is my condition?&nbsp; Depressed spirits, and ill
health; and the way as far as I can see before me, no better, nay
worse than the lengths behind.&nbsp; What right have I to
hope?&nbsp; The ring and the lamp of the Arabian tales must cease
to be fiction, before I can have any chance of good
fortune.&nbsp; <!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>But I do not call for pity.&nbsp; If
I have not learned to be skilful in parrying and eluding the
blows of Adversity, from experience, I am at heart somewhat
hardened by long subjection, and habituation to them; and, if I
have not the soothing of Hope, I am not altogether without the
consolation of Philosophy.&nbsp; The happy must substract from
his happiness the frequent reflection, which comes like a cloud
over him, that death will snatch him from all his
blessings.&nbsp; The wretched finds relief in the certainty that
death will end his misery; therefore, that state is not very
enviable, nor this intolerable.&nbsp; Both will soon, very soon
be past, and small, indeed, is the difference between past
pleasure and past pain.&nbsp; Be assured, madam, that I, in
return, as warmly wish you prosperity and happiness; I wish not
only that the approaching, but many succeeding years, may have
both hands full of plenty and delight for you; and I trust that
it is not so unreasonable in you to believe, that future events
may give a character of prophecy to my present wishes, as it
would be in me to expect the fulfilment of yours.</p>
<p>Pray, have the goodness to tell my father, that the vol. of
Pickering, from Priestleys, is procured, and that the copy of the
Manuel Libraire, at Longman&rsquo;s is still to be sold at four
guineas.&nbsp; Pray, make my thanks to him for letting me know
the day of the sessions at Norwich; I shall be present to help to
do the nothing there.&nbsp; I suppose he knows that the
Corporation of Yarmouth have elected Mr. W---, to the
stewardship.&nbsp; I hear him say &lsquo;How stupid of them to
elect that fellow.&rsquo;&nbsp; I beg his pardon; it shewed
exquisite judgment; and yet, after all, there was somewhat of a
felicity in it.&nbsp; They thought it would be deserting
propriety <!-- page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>to have a man in the lower office of
steward of higher understanding than their Recorder.&nbsp; Now,
under all the fleecy cloud of wigs that lowers in the court of
King&rsquo;s Bench, they could not have found a second rate head
to A---s, but that of W---d, and nothing but &lsquo;a lucky hit
of nature&rsquo; that mended her design when she was determined
to make as thick a skull as she had ever yet turned out of her
hands, could have given existence even to this instance of
inferiority.&nbsp; He says he was quite ignorant of their
intention of the honour that has been done him.&nbsp; If this be
not affectation, I can imagine nothing with which to compare or
illustrate his surprise, except that which must have come over
the onion, when it discovered that the Egyptians had made a God
of it.&nbsp; I am wrong: surprise is the effect of perception and
he has none; his is like the genuine night, that admits no ray,
and in his very stupidity he is involved from the least
glimmering of consciousness of it.&nbsp; Pray, lessen the anxiety
of Harriet, which an unmerited affection for me betrays her into,
by telling her that I am getting better, and excuse the want of
turn to the conclusion of my letter in the want of paper; and
allow me abruptly to assure you that, I am, dear Madam,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Yours most faithfully,<br />
HENRY COOPER.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The following letter, the reader must think very piquant and
graphic, and it will, probably, tend to throw a new light upon
his preconceived opinions and estimation of a certain great

Sir George Cockburn had the command of the ship which conveyed
Napoleon and his suite to St. Helena.</p>

<p>To the same,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I am very much obliged to you for your
excellent and most welcome present [it is below the dignity of
the Epop&egrave;e to say goose and sausages] which reached me on
Sunday, and the note which you were so kind as to send with it, I
can only repay you in this the old paper of unproductive thanks,
but the sincerity of them will be held in some estimation by the
mind actuated by the kindness that has excited them, and,
therefore, flimsy as they are, I venture to beg your acceptance
of them.&nbsp; I have nothing new, Madam, to send you for your
entertainment from this great city.&nbsp; That the Regent is
going to divorce the Princess of Wales, and excite the hope of
the husbands and the fear of the wives&mdash;that under such an
example, all the legal restraints to repudiation will be removed,
and the practice become wide, and quite fashionable; you have, of
course, heard long ago from the newspapers, they are eternally
depriving us by anticipation of the power of writing agreeable
and interesting letters to the Ladies in the country.</p>
<p>Sir James Cockburn arrived in town last Saturday from
Bermudas.&nbsp; He is quite well, and neither seems nor believes
himself an hour older for having been three years at Bermudas,
since he was last in England.&nbsp; I have been much with him and
his brother, the Admiral, lately.&nbsp; I have not (for your sex
has not <span class="smcap">all</span> the curiosity, though all
of a peculiar kind) omitted to ply him with questions about
Buonaparte.&nbsp; He is now admirably qualified to be Emperor in
that country of which I have read, where they elect the fattest
man in the state to the Empire.&nbsp; His legs are as bulky as my
body, the ribs in proportion; and <!-- page 37--><a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>since this
girth is all attained in little more than five-feet five-inches
of length, he is not what Miss Cruso or Miss Godfrey [the head
milliners of Norwich at the time] would call a very genteel
figure.&nbsp; He eats with voraciousness of the most luxurious
dishes; he has, in Cockburn&rsquo;s opinion, a very mean
assemblage of features with something fearfully black and vicious
about the brows and eyes.&nbsp; His manners are coarse and
repulsive.&nbsp; Did you ever in a litter yard come suddenly on a
lady in the straw that starts up on her fore legs and, dropping
fourteen infant pigs from her teats, salutes you with a fierce
jumble of barking, grunting, and hissing?&nbsp; In exactly such a
sound is this amiable man represented to me to have always
replied to every address of Bertrand, Mouthoulon, and the others,
who are his fools and followers to St. Helena.&nbsp; Sometimes he
neglected all restraint on his nature, and gave the same
ferocious and inarticulate answers to the English officers.&nbsp;
He played chess so badly, that Bertrand and Mouthoulon, who had
too much discretion to excel their patron, had, at times, great
difficulty to lose the game to him; after trying for many nights
he could not attain the rudiments of whist, and went back to
vingt-un; but this is the man who has been described to us all as
<span class="smcap">all-intellect</span>.&nbsp; The newspapers,
too, said I remember, that at whist he left all instruction
behind him, and soon played so well, that he had won very large
sums of the Admiral by his superior play, even while he was only
a Tyro.&nbsp; I can tell you no more now; but the Admiral has had
the goodness to lend me a journal of his conversation with
Buonaparte on the passage out, and when I have the pleasure of
seeing you in the sessions week, I will give you some extracts
from my memory.&nbsp; I am, I <!-- page 38--><a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>believe, a
little better, but the disorder in the upper part of my stomach
still continues and oppresses me.&nbsp; It is now inveterate, the
complaint commenced last March, a twelvemonth past.&nbsp; If I
cannot rid myself of it, it will kill me in time.&nbsp; My best
duty to my father, love to William and &lsquo;aliis,&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">I am, dear Madam,<br />
Yours very faithfully,<br />
HENRY COOPER.</p>
<p>P.S.&mdash;I write in a great hurry for I am making up my
parcel for Bermudas.&nbsp; I should not write to you at all, but
I do not like so long to delay my due thanks to your
kindness.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote><p>I am scarcely warm in my place in London before I
have to thank you for your present to me; you hardly give me
time, in the short intervals of these marks of your kindness to
me, to frame my thanks to you for each.&nbsp; I have exhausted
all my common-place forms and am forced to rack my invention (so
very often have you come forward with these welcome claims on me)
to give anything like a turn to the expression in which to convey
my thanks.&nbsp; Mr. Pope (in those rhymes for the nursery which
he has entitled the Universal Prayer) calls enjoyment obedience:
now if enjoyment be thankfulness, too, then never was a being
more completely thanked than yourself; for the ducks were
devoured with the most devout gust and appetite; they were the
most superb fowls that ever suffered martyrdom of their lives to
delight the palate and appease the hunger of the Lords of the
creation.&nbsp; <!-- page 39--><a name="page39"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>You should have sent them to some
imitator of the Dutch school, who could have painted them before
he ate them; the hare, too, is as good as it can be, and you are
agreeably thanked for it by an equal portion of enjoyment.</p>
<p>I must beg you to excuse a very short, dull, and hasty letter,
from me.&nbsp; If I were not impatient at the thought of letting
any longer time elapse without expressing my lively sense of your
frequent mark of kind consideration of me, I should not write at
all to day.&nbsp; I have something to do at my chambers, and in
ten minutes I must run down to Westminster Hall; and whilst I am
thus engaged, I am as much disqualified for writing, by a dark
fit of low spirits, as prevented by want of leisure.&nbsp; I
resist as much as I can these attacks of the night-mare by day,
but I cannot wholly succeed against them; my circumstances may
possibly change, and, if not, such gloominess is unreasonable; if
Fortune is never weary of persecuting me, I shall at last be past
the sense of her persecutions.&nbsp; In the meantime, whatever is
the colour of my life, I shall, if I can, continue to hope the
future cannot be the worse, and the present will be the more
tolerable for it.&nbsp; I shall, therefore, cling to her while I
live, and to apply a beautiful thought of Tibullus&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dying, clasp her with my failing hand.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In endeavouring to recollect me of the many fine things that
have been said of hope to crown my declaration of attachment to
that first place of our lives, I remember Cowley has observed
&lsquo;that it is as much destroyed by the possession of its
object as by exclusion from it.&rsquo;&nbsp; This is very
ingenious and very true, and though not to the purpose for which
I was seeking it <!-- page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>yet will very well serve
another.&nbsp; I wish my dear Madam, very sincerely, that the
former mode of destruction may speedily befall all your present
hopes, and that in future you will be surrounded by so many
blessings as will leave you no room for the exercise of any hope
but their continuance, My duty to my father, and my love to
William, I trust that he improves in Latin; pray tell him that I
was vexed not to find him so good a scholar in that language as I
expected; when I next see him I hope my expectations will be
exceeded.</p>

<p>The following letter I have previously made reference

sorrow, under the shock of the frightful calamity.&nbsp; It
relates to the disastrous death of poor Alfred, his youngest
brother.&nbsp; It is dated from, and bears date</p>

<blockquote><p>I received your letter yesterday, but I was so ill
(that important as the occasion is) I could not answer it.&nbsp;
To-day, nothing less than the urgency of the subject could
prevail upon me to make the smallest exertion, for I am scarcely
able to drag one limb up to the other.&nbsp; I have a violent
catarrh, the glands of my throat are further inflamed and
ulcerated, and I am burning with fever.</p>
<p>With regard to divulging to Harriet the disastrous event, for
which, when once known to her, she can never be consoled; I am in
a very unfit state to give advice.&nbsp; I am as I have always
been of opinion, that it should be concealed from her as long as
it can.&nbsp; It is a more <!-- page 41--><a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>generous
cause of grief than the loss of a lover; and as Harriet&rsquo;s
mind is built, I think more likely to shock and destroy
her.&nbsp; You state only one reason for breaking the secrecy
which has hitherto been observed&mdash;that it appears strange,
the event public, that you are not in mourning for it.&nbsp; I
cannot but think that if any good can reasonably be expected from
withholding the knowledge of this dreadful incident, it would be
wrong and trifling to forego it, for the senseless custom of
putting yourself in black for a few months.&nbsp; I have no crape
about me.&nbsp; If any one were to ask the cause of my disregard
of a paltry decorum, I should either turn on my heel from him, or
explain to him that I did not put on the mockery of sorrow, lest
it should get to my sister&rsquo;s ear; that I was in outward
mourning, and she had to be discovering for whom.</p>
<p>It is, surely, easy for you to say that you do not put on
black for the same reason, to all who may enquire, or to all
those to whom you wish to appear decorous.&nbsp; [He then writes
on family matters, but, after a few lines, again recurs to the
painful subject of his letter.]&nbsp; It is known to several with
whom I am acquainted in London; but, it is easy, as Harriet
restricts herself to a very narrow intercourse, to keep it still
from her knowledge, till she has recovered strength of body to
contend anew with severe and heavy affliction.&nbsp; How much I
have suffered from the intelligence I shall not attempt to
describe to you.&nbsp; I had but little interest in life before;
it is now heavy and sickening to me.&nbsp; I feel as if I never
should smile again; every circumstance of aggravation attends
it.&nbsp; To perish on the verge of the shore, when he was just
about to embark, after six years in the climate, when we thought
the danger past.&nbsp; <!-- page 42--><a name="page42"></a><span

felicitation of himself, and rapture at the hope of soon meeting
us again, and when we were expecting him every moment in our
embrace, to be struck cold to the heart with the news that we
should never see him again.&nbsp; I owe little to man&mdash;I
shall soon owe nothing to any other being.&nbsp; I hate the cant
of the doctrine of Providence &lsquo;your brother may be snatched
by a merciful power from impending evil.&rsquo;&nbsp; Bah! why
not the merciful being continue life to my brother, and destroy
the impending evil?&nbsp; Well, I shall soon be as he is, and
though there is no consolation in that feeling, it is some
assuagement of grief, because sorrow will then be at an
end.&nbsp; My duty to my father.&nbsp; I write in great pain.</p>

<p>The following makes the last of the letters I possess, and is
written six months previous to his death; and in answer to a
letter, of my mother to him, respecting the appointment of a paid
chairman, and he, a barrister of some standing, to preside at
Quarter Sessions, and to have besides (if my recollection be
correct) some civil power.&nbsp; This was then in the
contemplation of the Ministry; and as the poet says &ldquo;coming
events cast their shadows before&rdquo; evidently the shadow of
the present county courts.&nbsp; The letter is dated from and
bears date,</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">5, Hare Court,
Temple.<br />
6th March, 1824.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To the same,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I did not return to Town till Sunday
morning, when I found your letter at my chambers.&nbsp; I hope
you <!-- page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>will accept, as a sufficient excuse, the extreme fatigue
and languor which I felt all yesterday for not answering it
immediately.</p>
<p>I lament exceedingly, that my father should not have been
early enough in his application to the Lieutenant of the County,
in whose gift, by the frame of the bill, the appointment is
placed, and in whose hand, I fear, by the act itself it will
remain.</p>
<p>I cannot conjecture to whom it has been promised by Col.
Wodehouse.&nbsp; To Alderson is not at all probable, from the
part he has taken against the Wodehouse&rsquo;s, who are the most
bigoted and relentless Tories in existence.&nbsp; To Preston
[another provincial barrister in Norwich, and the late Jermy, who
was shot by Rush], ought not to be probable, because he is not
competent either in law or common sense to fill the office; and
the favour to him would be an injury to the public.&nbsp; My
father has every claim to it, and I think that it would have been
no more than what was due from Col. Wodehouse, both to the county
and my father, to offer it to him before he promised it to
another.</p>
<p>I wish you might be right in your surmise, that the patronage
will be placed in another quarter; but, of that there is the
faintest chance, I should advise you to press my father to exert
himself to procure the appointment, as it will be an office of
the most agreeable kind, affording considerable profit at very
little trouble.&nbsp; I, myself, know not a soul in the world who
could influence any one of the present government: and any
enquiries or attempt by me would have, in all probability, an
adverse operation.&nbsp; I am of no importance whatever to any
party, but my opinions, humble and insignificant as they are,
have been noticed and recorded; and I am down in the black <!--
page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>book for persecution, rather than in the red for
favour.&nbsp; Of little note and importance as I am, such is the
consciousness, in their own infirmity, in those who rule us, that
the very lowest who have denounced their system, are objects of
their hatred, for they are the objects of their fear; and those
who have put them to the pain of apprehension, are marks for
their revenge.&nbsp; I should think that the best course that my
father could take would be to apply to Mr. John Harvey, to induce
his brother, Onley Harvey, Esq. (a brother barrister of my father
too), to ask it of the Home Department; if he asked it (supposing
the gift to be there), I think, without doubt it would be
given.&nbsp; [The rest of the letter relates to family matters,
and concludes my love to William.&nbsp; He attributes too much
honour to me by looking to me with any admiration.]&nbsp; My duty

<p>My task is all but accomplished.&nbsp; I have but now to lay
before the reader the promised verses; those on Buonaparte are
characteristic of the writer, who, with his high intellectual
powers, possessed to the last, a noble and independent spirit,
which despised even the appearance of servility.&nbsp; I shall
then add the notices that appeared in the <i>Morning
Chronicle</i>, and <i>Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine</i>, soon after
his decease, which clearly show <!-- page 45--><a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>that He,
whose death they record, was no common person; as, also, the high
estimation he was held in by the profession, to which he was an
honour; and by the public who admired him for his eloquence, and
prized him for his independence of character.&nbsp; In the
sketches I have given of the two lives, which were, of necessity
intermingled,&mdash;it is true, I have given but a rough outline
of each, and my hope is they will portray the lineaments and
character as effectually as a more lengthened biography; as I
have seen, and often the character of a friend&rsquo;s face
better given in a few mere outlines, than in the finished
likeness.&nbsp; In looking at a small duodecimo edition I possess
of Plutarch&rsquo;s lives, I perceive that the lives of his
greatest heroes and statesmen, are comprised within a hundred
pages, and yet how clearly does he portray their lives to the
reader.&nbsp; He gives a few anecdotes of their youth, a few
salient points of their character in manhood, and then concludes
with their actions and their deaths; and leaves the rest to the
imagination and &ldquo;the mind&rsquo;s eye;&rdquo; and who,
after, reading them, does not see clearly before him the man
whose life has been so ably delineated?&nbsp; I mean not, by
this, to compare myself for an instant, with that great writer;
but, having, as I said before, such slender materials to deal
with, I have, as far as I was able, and after re-perusing the
writer referred to, done my best, with my small abilities to
follow his example, and pursue his arrangement; I can only hope I
may have in part succeeded.</p>
<p>After the notices referred to, I shall end by laying before
the reader the verses written on my brother, after his death, by
my mother and Mr. Wing; and in the appendix I shall refer the
reader to the life of Erskine <!-- page 46--><a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>before
alluded to; as, also, to the trial of Mary Ann Carlile, which
will show, and clearly, the style of the eloquence of her
advocate on the occasion, combined as it is with powerful
argument, and that clearness and lucid order which were his
forte.&nbsp; And now, reader, to use the words of Cicero, in
concluding one of his epistles to a friend, &ldquo;vale et

50</span>In the <i>Chronicle</i> of September 27th, 1824,
appeared the following notice of my brother&rsquo;s death,
headed:&mdash;&ldquo;Death of Henry Cooper.&mdash;We regret to
have to announce the death of a gentleman warmly beloved by all
who knew him, Mr. Henry Cooper the barrister.&nbsp; He died on
Sunday the 19th, at the cottage of his friend, Mr. Hill, of
Chelsea, after a short illness which brought on an inflammation
in his bowels that proved fatal; he was interred on Friday
last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Cooper had overcome the difficulties of his
profession, and was rising fast into eminence.&nbsp; He was
already leader on the Norfolk circuit, and with his readiness,
his powerful memory, and his forcible and fluent delivery, the
most distinguished success was universally anticipated for him:
his vein of pleasantry was particularly rich, as an instance we
may refer to a case on the very last circuit in which a
hairdresser of Newmarket was one of the parties, and which he
made irresistibly amusing.&nbsp; We appeal confidently to those
of our readers who have attentively considered the signs of the
times, if there was not much distrust of the bar about the period
when Mr. Henry Cooper came into notice, and if he did not by his
exertions contribute greatly to remove it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had been sometime employed procuring materials for a
life of Lord Erskine, with whom he was particularly intimate,
which he had undertaken to write; we suspect he had not made much
progress in the work when death erminated all his
labour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next notice of his death is taken from the
<i>Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine</i>, from July to December, 1824;
vol. 94, part 2.&mdash;&ldquo;On the 19th of September, 1824, at
Chelsea, Henry Cooper, barrister-at-law, in the vigour of life
and with every prospect of reaching the highest honors in his
profession.&nbsp; The death of this rising barrister <!-- page
51--><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>has
been recorded in page 381 [as above].&nbsp; He died of
inflammation of the bowels, at the house of his friend, Mr. Hill,
at Chelsea.&nbsp; His age was about thirty-eight or thirty-nine,
and he had been about twelve years at the bar.&nbsp; He was the
son of a counsel of eminence residing at Norwich.&nbsp; He went
to sea with Lord Nelson, and was present at the battle of the
Nile, but he early quitted the naval profession for that of the
law, though he retained much of the frankness and gaiety of
manner which distinguish seamen, and the activity and strength of
frame which a seaman&rsquo;s habits create.&nbsp; He was
afterwards Attorney General of the Bermudas, at the time when one
of the Cockburn&rsquo;s was governor.&nbsp; On the appointment of
the late Mr. Serjeant Blossett to the Chief Justiceship of
Bengal, Mr. Cooper, who was then rapidly rising on his circuit
(the Norfolk) became one of the leaders; and at the two last
assizes, was in every cause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He possessed great activity and versatility of mind; no
one, according to the testimony of those who saw most of him,
combined with a fluent and powerful eloquence, a better judgment
and nicer skill in conducting a cause.&nbsp; But his best and
highest forensic quality, and that which, combined with his
talents, make the loss a national one, was his great moral and
professional courage, his unshaken attachment to what he
considered a good cause.&nbsp; No consideration ever warped him
from his duty.&nbsp; He was proof not merely against those
speculations on the best probable means of personal advancement
which many men reject as well as he did, but against that desire
of standing well with the judges, of getting the ear of the
judge, of obtaining the sympathy of men of professional standing,
which it requires much more firmness to resist; there was no one
on whom a defendant <!-- page 52--><a name="page52"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>exposed to the enmity of government,
or to the judges, or to any prejudices, could rely with greater
certainty; that he would not be compromised or betrayed by his
advocate.&nbsp; In a word, there was no man less of a
sycophant.&nbsp; He had a confidence that he could make himself a
name by his own merits, and he would have it.</p>

find,<br />
Comes the blind Fury with the abhorred shears<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Is quenched by the cold hand of death.</p>
<p>Yet a balm to his friends shall arise,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Untarnished in lustre or fame.</p>

55</span>APPENDIX.<br />
THE LIFE OF LORD ERSKINE.<br />
<span class="smcap">as commenced by my brother</span></h2>
<p>Thomas Erskine, the only advocate, and, almost, the only
orator, whose speeches are likely to survive the interest of the
occasion that gave them birth in a country, where forensic
litigation abounds, and political institutions render the study
and exercise of eloquence important and necessary, was born on
the in --- the year 175, at ---, in Scotland; he was the third
son of the Earl of Buchan, by ---.&nbsp; This family is ancient,
and connects, with its pedigree, the sovereigns, both of Scotland
and England, related to the former.&nbsp; The marriage of the
daughter of James the First with the Palatine, mixed his line
with the descendants, and, consequently, united him with the
family that now reigns in England.&nbsp; He thus brought with him
to the profession of the bar, the advantage of all the prejudice
in favour of illustrious descents, and found easier way yielded
to his powerful talents by the diminution of envy which attended
it.</p>
<p>Of his very early years, I am unable to supply the public with
any information, and I regret it,&mdash;not that any very
important lesson of utility can be derived from the anecdotes of
childhood, but they are amusing, and amusing without harm; and I
agree with Dr. West <!-- page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>that he has a very imperfect
knowledge of human nature who is not convinced, that in a state
of refined society, it is impossible to amuse innocently.&nbsp;
All that I have been able to learn distinctly, is, that the most
playful vivacity, and the same good humour, which ever after
accompanied him even in the keenest rivalry of the bar, displayed
itself in his words and actions, and made him the delight of all,
but those who morose and splenetic, from their own disgust of
existence, conceive offence at others for that enjoyment of the
present, which can only subsist upon ignorance, and the hope of
the future that <span class="smcap">must be</span>
disappointed.&nbsp; To this vivacity, he, perhaps, owed as much
as to those endowments, which are deemed more solid
qualifications for the bar.&nbsp; It imparted itself to his eye,
his mouth, his tone, and his action, and held his hearers
engaged, when his periods were such as pronounced by an ordinary
speaker, would not have preserved the audience from that
listnessness, which is instantly seen and felt by the speaker,
and soon adds embarrassment and confusion to feebleness.&nbsp; In
private society, to the last months of his existence, it gave him
rather the air of a youth inexperienced in the realities of life,
and entering it under the ardour of hope, than of a man who had
almost reached the limits of human existence, in the exercise of
a profession, which lays the human breast naked to
inspection.&nbsp; It was said of Pope, from his primitive habits
of reflection and gravity, that he was never young; and, on the
contrary, it may be said with equal justice, from the playfulness
and vivacity of Erskine, that he was never old.&nbsp; At the age
of he entered the navy as a midshipman, and served in the ---,
commanded by Captain ---, in America.&nbsp; While in this station
he was employed in making a <!-- page 57--><a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>survey under
one of the lieutenants of the ship, off the coast of
Florida.&nbsp; He had some acquaintance with geometry; and, as he
tells us himself in his &ldquo;Armata,&rdquo; always retained a
fondness for that science.&nbsp; Whether this fondness grew in
acquiring the knowledge of navigation, indispensable to his
profession, or subsequently at the university in which it forms
so much the greater part of education, I am ignorant; but that he
was versed to a degree both in geometry and astronomy, is
evident, from the work I have named, and some pieces of his
poetry, which I have had access to.&nbsp; The cause that led him
to leave the navy and enter the army is unknown; it is most
likely to have been disgust and impatience of the subordination,
which in our fleets is rigid in the extreme, and never softened
by that alternation of social intercourse, at a common table at
which in the army, all the officers of the regiment meet daily,
and from which they rise with a feeling, not only that insulting
and overbearing command upon duty would be a violation of an
implied pledge of kindness, but injury to themselves, as
diminishing in the gloom that would spread over their next
meeting, the common stock of enjoyment.&nbsp; The condition of
our naval service is, in some respects, improved since Erskine
was a member of it; but then all knowledge beyond that of the
conduct of a ship, was deemed unnecessary, impertinent, and even
adverse to the attainment of nautical skill.&nbsp; The
intercourse of the officers even on the shore, was confined
almost entirely to one another, for not to speak of the
uncouthness of their habits, which made them as incapable of
mingling in society on land, as the beings of their element on
which their avocation lay, are of living in the air, their
language <!-- page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>was technical to a degree that
rendered it to all, except themselves, almost
unintelligible.&nbsp; With such persons for companions, and to
use Terence&rsquo;s expression, quotidian and tedious sameness of
a life at sea, we need look no further for Erskine&rsquo;s desire
to change his profession.&nbsp; When we consider the great
capacity which he possessed for observation, and his
extraordinary power of combining the knowledge that he so
acquired, the period which he gave to the naval service must have
been, to a spirit so active, a period of painful
constraints.&nbsp; I remember that in a conversation upon Lord
Erskine, with Mr. Capel Loft, after enumerating the many great
causes in which the great advocate had been engaged, he
exclaimed, &ldquo;what an infinite multitude of ideas must have
passed through that man&rsquo;s mind.&rdquo;&nbsp; The remark is
not an empty one; I doubt whether there ever was a man who
exercised the faculty of reasoning more, who drew a greater
number of distinct conclusions, or whose materials of thought
were more the collection and property of his own
observation.&nbsp; Cicero, in his speech for Archias, appeals to
the judges whether he could possibly supply the demands upon him
for daily exertions of eloquence, unless he assidiously refreshed
his mind with studies, in which he was assisted by Archias and
other rhetoricians, and that he read copiously is manifested in
all his works.&nbsp; The accomplished academician, the able
balancer of the different schools of philosophy and morals, and
the studied Rhetor is obtruded upon us.&nbsp; He was, in every
sense of the term, learned; Erskine, on the contrary, cannot be
discovered by any of his speeches, or writings, to have read
much, and most probably had read very little.&nbsp; He was in no
sense of the word learned.&nbsp; He has, indeed by acuteness of
observation, <!-- page 59--><a name="page59"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 59</span>vigour of combination, and the ready
power of deduction that he possessed, been able to produce and
leave behind him what will become the learning of others, but he
was not learned himself.&nbsp; His qualities, from his earliest
years were quickness and acuteness, unchecked and insatiable
curiosity, retentive memory, and busy reflection; his mind was
never still.&nbsp; In the coffee-room he conversed and indulged
in humour with all round him.&nbsp; However important or heavy
the causes which were to occupy him in court, they never
oppressed his mind with a load of anxiety; his was not like
ordinary minds under great affairs, so absorbed that he could
perceive nothing round him; his, till the hour of solemn exertion
arrived, was disengaged and indulged in pleasantry; after the
toil of the day, the passion of eloquence and the intensity of
technical argument, he was full of spirits and waggery at dinner
and in the evening.&nbsp; And light as his topics sometimes were,
his thoughts were always distinct, and his expressions full; you
never from him heard any imperfect thoughts expressed, that (like
tadpoles, before they are complete, must go through other
processes of animation) required the exertion of your own
conceptions to attain their sense and spirit.&nbsp; The activity
of his mind was like that of the swallow, which either in sport
or pursuit is upon the wing for ever.&nbsp; With this character
it may readily be believed that young Erskine received his
discharge with feelings like those that attend the cessation of a
long and painful disease from a state which called for no
exercise of his great talents, and, neither yielded scope for the
communication of his own attainments nor opportunity to increase
them from the communications of others.</p>
<p>He became an ensign of the Royals and married not long <!--
page 60--><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>after.&nbsp; He was sent with his corps to the
Mediterranean, and stationed either with his regiment or a
detachment of his regiment, at Minorca; there, under the
influence of an ardent feeling of religion, which he owed to the
anxious inculcations of his mother, from whom he received the
rudiments of education, he is said in the absence of the
chaplain, to have composed more than one sermon, and to have
delivered them to the assembled officers and privates of his
regiment.&nbsp; It never occurred to me to ask him whether there
was truth in this report; but he has frequently talked to me of
anecdotes which were circulated of him, some of which he
confirmed while he contradicted others, and never spoke of this
as unfounded; from my knowledge of his character it is highly
probable, and I believe it is true.&nbsp; About three years ago
he was at Tunbridge Wells with Mr. Coutts, and while there,
pointed out to a friend of mine a building, and said,
&ldquo;There, when it was a public room, I preached a sermon of
my own composition to the company;&rdquo; this was for a
wager.&nbsp; He returned to England in 17-- with his regiment,
the father of three children.&nbsp; The anxiety of his mother,
whose affections and care for her family rendered her most
estimable, and have endeared her memory to her descendants, was
excited by Thomas, who had nothing but his pay for the support of
his wife and his children, likely soon to become more
numerous.&nbsp; Her prudence suggested to her another profession
for him by the gains of which he might avoid the destitution
which she saw hanging over his head.&nbsp; With this design, she
sent for Mr. Adam, the barrister (now the Commissioner of the
Scotch jury courts), that she might receive the assistance of his
experience and advice.&nbsp; On his arrival she said, &ldquo;My
son Tom has been thoughtless enough to <!-- page 61--><a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>marry a woman
without fortune, and she has brought him a family which he cannot
support himself, nor I for him,&mdash;what is to be done?&nbsp;
And I have been thinking that he must sell his commission, go to
the bar, and be Lord Chancellor.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is interesting
to reflect, that while this excellent woman was endeavouring to
conceal the bitterness of an affectionate mother&rsquo;s anguish
for her son&rsquo;s imprudence, she was unconsciously pronouncing
a prophecy.&nbsp; Nor will it be less to see how trifling an
event would have prevented its accomplishment; Mr. Adam told her
that there were a great many steps from the entrance of the
profession and the very high rank which she purposed, many of
which he should be happy to congratulate her son on
attaining.&nbsp; The conference proceeded, the obstacles to
success at the bar were weighed against the certainty of domestic
calamities if he remained in his present profession, and they
parted, both of opinion, that in the direction of the bar, Thomas
Erskine was most likely to leave behind his present embarrassment
and reach prosperity.&nbsp; It remained, however, to procure the
consent of her son; that was not easy: he had no predilection for
the bar, and was attached to the army, and his regiment, to the
officers of which his sprightly and amiable manners had endeared
him, and in which he was soliciting promotion and expecting
it.&nbsp; At last, however, his conditional consent was drawn
from him.&nbsp; He agreed to let his mother dispose of him as she
wished, if he should be unsuccessful in his application for the
vacant captaincy in the Royals.&nbsp; This was far from
satisfying his mother, but he was peremptory, and she could not
induce him to more positive terms; thus, if Erskine could have
gained the rank of captain in the Royals, the destination of
which was, then, an <!-- page 62--><a name="page62"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 62</span>American colony, by which he might
have gained the privilege of being scalped by the savages, or
perishing in the swamps or forests of North America, the country
would never have known that splendid eloquence, which is its
boast and its pride; Tooke, Thelwall, Hardy, and the rest of
those unfortunate men who were held so long under the terror of
death, would probably have been hanged, and the country oppressed
by a gloomy precedent of constructive treason, under which no man
who has raised himself in opposition to a corrupt and sinister
government could have been safe; one is inclined to shudder, like
a man whom a shot has missed only by the breadth of a hair, in
contemplating how near so much danger was incurred, and so much
benefit lost.&nbsp; But it is not on the magnitude, but
continuity of the chain, that great results depend; on examining
the past, we shall find that as small a link struck out at one
point or other of succession, would have disappointed the most
important events of history.&nbsp; Happily for Erskine and his
country, his claims from the merit of his services were eluded,
and though he was more urgent in his applications, since the
alternative was to be the bar, he was refused promotion.&nbsp;
There was a singular coincidence in the fortune of the late Lord
Chatham and Erskine: the former was sent into parliament and
driven into violent opposition to Sir Robert Walpole, because
that minister had deprived him of a company of horse, and
dismissed him the service, an act of which the minister had
reason to repent.&nbsp; He was like the emblem of envy with the
recoiled dart in his own bosom; except Charles I., who stopped
Hampden and Cromwell from embarking upon the Thames to follow
liberty into the wilderness of America, no man had ever so much
reason <!-- page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>to curse himself for his own
acts.&nbsp; In the same manner a slight of Erskine&rsquo;s claims
to promotion sent him to display an eloquence that had never yet
been heard at the English bar.&nbsp; His fame as an advocate,
drew the notice of the Whig party on him; he was enlisted in
their ranks and added an importance to the opposition, which not
unfrequently increased the embarrassment of the minister.&nbsp;
While he was held in suspense by those who had the disposal of
commissions, he was quartered at Maidstone, and entering the
court during the assizes there, was placed in his military
uniform upon the bench, beside the great Lord Mansfield, to whom
he was distantly related, and who at intervals of business,
conversed with him on the proposed change of arms for the
gown.&nbsp; This was another of the accidents which, by minds of
a certain frame would be regarded as an omen.&nbsp; After
relating this anecdote, he added, &ldquo;Only four years from
that time, I was at the place in the lead of that very
circuit.&rdquo;&nbsp; All his hopes of promotion at an end, the
commission so unequal to the demands for subsistance upon it, was
disposed of, and he was at once entered a student of the Law
Society of Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn, and a Commoner at --- College,
Cambridge</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>A few days before he was called to the bar, a friend came and
invited him to accompany him to dine at the villa of a wine
merchant, a few miles from London.&nbsp; The allurements were a
good dinner, and wine not to be procured but by a dealer, who
could cull his own stock from thousands of pipes, and they were
not to be resisted <!-- page 64--><a name="page64"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 64</span>by a young man fond of pleasure, to
whom such luxuries must come gratuitously, if they come at
all.&nbsp; Economy, which was important to Erskine, was not quite
beneath the regard of his friend, and after many proposals of
several modes of conveyance, which were all rejected, either for
their expense, or their humbleness, they agreed to walk; I have
heard playful exertions of the mind or body attributed to what
was denominated an excessive flow of animal spirits, a phrase
that sounds significantly in the ear, but gives no information to
the understanding.&nbsp; Those who use it, mean, I suppose, to
express that when the body has received more nutriment than is
necessary to promote its growth, or maintain it the redundancy is
thrown off in almost involuntary exertions of the limbs or of
mind.&nbsp; If this physiology be just, Erskine had an
extraordinary surplus of supply,&mdash;that regular discharge
like the back water of a mill, and it found vent in various
gambols and effusions of humour on the way to the wine
merchant&rsquo;s.&nbsp; While Erskine, buoyed by high health and
ardent hope, scarcely felt the ground that he trod, the sight of
a ditch by the side of the road, tempted him to exercise his
agility.&nbsp; The impulse, and obedience to the impulse, were
the same.&nbsp; He made the attempt, but the ditch was too wide
for his spring, and he leaped a little short of the opposite
bank.&nbsp; His dress above was splashed with foul water, and his
legs booted in mud.&nbsp; Nothing was to be done on his part but
to return, and his companion with a kindness that does him
honour, would have returned with him, but this, Erskine was too
generous to allow; and while his friend continued his journey to
the wine merchant&rsquo;s house and sumptuous dinner, Erskine
solitary and in pain (for he had severely sprained his leg)
returned to <!-- page 65--><a name="page65"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 65</span>town; on reaching his lodgings Mrs.
Erskine proposed a change of dress, and urged him yet to go to
dinner at the wine merchant&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He objected his
lameness from the sprain, which she answered by proposing a coach
and the expense, which he hinted, was not to be weighed against
the benefit he might derive from the friends which his manners
and spirits were likely to make him in the mixed and numerous
company he would meet there.&nbsp; This was a consideration so
important to a young man on the verge of the bar, that
Erskine&rsquo;s disinclination was overcome by these reasonings
of his wife.&nbsp; A coach was procured, and he again set out,
but he did not arrive till dinner was half over, and found
himself placed by this accident by the side of Captain Bailey, of
Greenwich Hospital.&nbsp; With the modesty which is always united
with true genius, Lord Erskine always spoke of this event as the
greatest instance of good fortune which ever befel him.&nbsp; But
for this, he said to me, &ldquo;I might have waited years for an
opportunity to show that I had any talent for the bar; and when
it occurred I should not have pleaded with such effect, depressed
and mortified as I might have been by long expectation, and its
attendant evils, instead of seizing it with all the energy and
confidence of youth elated with hope.&rdquo;&nbsp; I record this
to show how little he was actuated by arrogance or presumption; I
by no means assent to his opinion, on the contrary, I think he
would have waited a very short time for occasion to exert his
prominent talents.&nbsp; He slipt from high ground into the
profession.&nbsp; His rank would have drawn notice upon him, and
he had friends full of eagerness, and not altogether without
power.&nbsp; No more is the partiality which, it is said, was
manifestly shown him by Lord Mansfield, to be deemed a main <!--
page 66--><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>cause of his success.&nbsp; On the contrary I am so
little inclined to attribute such an effect to it, that I believe
even the hostility of the bench could not have kept Erskine from
rising.&nbsp; His mind was not of the ordinary mould,&mdash;he
was excited by obstacles.&nbsp; Such was his temperament, that
the damp slight of discouragement which would have quenched
common spirits, by the ardour of his mind would have been
converted into fuel, and have increased the splendour with which
he burst forth at once at the English bar.&nbsp; How was the
delay of opportunity, or the frown of the judge to suppress the
eloquence whose first essay excelled, both in matter and
delivery, the latest efforts of the most experienced speakers in
our courts? when he rose Dunning, Bearcroft, Wallace and others,
were in the height of their reputation as speakers in Westminster
Hall.&nbsp; They were even eloquent, according to the judgment of
the day gazed at as the luminaries of the profession; but,
brilliant as they were, they were combust in the splendour of
Erskine, on his first appearance as an orator.&nbsp; This
considered, it is in vain to pretend, that, but for favourable
conjunctions which have happened to him and not to others, the
prosperous and devious career on which he immediately entered,
could have been prevented or even long delayed.&mdash;[Alas, no
more!]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tindall</span> opened the

please your lordship; gentlemen of the Jury; my friend, Mr.
Tindall, has told you the nature of this action, and it is now my
duty to lay this case before you.&nbsp; The indictment has been
found by a grand jury, upon the prosecution of the Constitutional
Association; and it charges the defendant, Mary Ann Carlile, with
publishing a libel upon the government and the constitution of
this country; and, gentlemen, after a not very limited experience
in these cases, I will say, that a more criminal and atrocious
libel never met my observation.&nbsp; It purports to be written
by Richard Carlile; it is dated from Dorchester Gaol, and it has
been published by the defendant, the sister of that man who is
now suffering imprisonment for his own criminal conduct.&nbsp; It
is entitled, &ldquo;A New Year&rsquo;s Address to the Reformers
of Great Britain;&rdquo; and, among other objectionable passages
not charged as libelous, it contains the following; &ldquo;As far
as the barrack system will admit&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>Mr. Justice <span class="smcap">Best</span>.&mdash;I do not
think that you are entitled to read that passage, Mr. Gurney.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>.&mdash;I think not, my
lord; I was just rising to interrupt Mr. Gurney.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gurney</span>.&mdash;I have no
objection, my lord, to abstain from reading the passage to which
I was about to call your attention.&nbsp; I shall read the
passage which is charged as libelous, and if the learned counsel
for the defendant can find throughout a single passage to qualify
its malignity, do you, gentleman, give the defendant the benefit
of it.&nbsp; The passage is this:&mdash;&ldquo;To talk about the
British Constitution, is, in my opinion, a sure proof of
dishonesty; Britain has no constitution.&nbsp; If we speak of the
Spanish constitution, we have something <!-- page 73--><a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>tangible;
there is a substance and meaning as well as sound.&nbsp; In
Britain there is nothing constituted but corruption in the system
of government; our very laws are corrupt and partial, both in
themselves and in their administration; in fact, corruption as
notorious as the sun at noon-day, is an avowed part of our
system, and is denominated the necessary oil for the wheels of
the government; it is a most pernicious oil to the interests of
the people.&rdquo;&nbsp; And in another passage the following
words were contained:&mdash;&ldquo;Reform will be obtained when
the existing authorities have no longer the power to withhold it,
and not before.&nbsp; We shall gain it as early without
petitioning as with it, and I would again put forward my opinion,
that something more than a petitioning attitude is
necessary.&nbsp; At this moment I would not say a word about
insurrection, but I would strongly recommend union, activity, and
co-operation.&nbsp; Be ready and steady to meet any concurrent
circumstances.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, gentleman, these are the
passages charged as libelous, and I defy even the ingenuity of my
learned friend to show that they are not most odious
libels.&nbsp; What! are the people of this free and independent
country to be told that they have no constitution?&nbsp; It is an
assertion, the malignity of which is only equalled by its
falsehood.&nbsp; We have a free and glorious constitution.&nbsp;
It has descended to us from our brave and free ancestors, and I
trust that we, too, shall have virtue and magnanimity enough to
transmit it unimpaired to our posterity.&nbsp; We have laws, too,
equal in their administration.&nbsp; We have a constitution where
no lowness of birth&mdash;no meanness of origin&mdash;operate as
an obstacle to preferment; in which the chief situations are open
to competition, and for which the only qualifications are
integrity and information.&nbsp; Our laws are here <!-- page
74--><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>stigmatized as partial and corrupt.&nbsp; If they were
not impartial, this man would never have dared to vilify
them.&nbsp; The very accusation proves that the charge is false;
for if it were true, this libeler must have suddenly suffered for
this assertion.&nbsp; It is because that they are administered in
a spirit of mercy unknown to the laws of any other
country&mdash;it is because they are administered in tenderness,
that this man has had the power to promulgate his vile and odious
falsehood.&nbsp; He thought it meet and right, and most becoming
too, to tell the world that this was not the precise time for
insurrection.&nbsp; He plainly indicates, that he has no
objection to it; but he would not say a word about it at present,
the time was not come; but he tells his fellow reformers to be
&ldquo;ready and steady to meet any concurrent
circumstances.&rdquo;&nbsp; Gentlemen, it would be an idle and
impertinent waste of time to make any further observations upon
the pernicious tendency of this libel.&nbsp; But what is the
defence which is to be set up by my learned friend?&nbsp; Are we
to be told that the prosecution of this libel is an invasion of
the liberty of the press?&nbsp; I will not yield to my learned
friend, nor to any man in existence, in a just regard for the
freedom of the press.&nbsp; But who, I would ask, is invading its
liberty?&nbsp; He who brings to justice the offenders, or he who
under the sacred form of liberty promulgates such language as I
have just read to you?&nbsp; I do not think that on this subject
you can entertain a doubt.&nbsp; I feel the most perfect
confidence in committing this case to your good sense.&nbsp; If
you believe that the defendant is guilty of publishing this libel
with the intention charged, you will pronounce your verdict of
guilty.&nbsp; If, on the other hand, you think that the passages
which I have read to you contain nothing libelous, or that the
defendant is not <!-- page 75--><a name="page75"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>the publisher, I shall sincerely
rejoice in your conscientious acquittal.</p>
<p><i>James Rignall</i> deposed, that he had purchased the
pamphlet in question of the defendant, at her shop in Fleet
Street, on Friday evening, the 9th of March.&nbsp; There were
several other copies lying about on the counter.</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. <span
class="smcap">Cooper</span>.&mdash;Who are you?&mdash;I am an
agent to the Society for the Suppression of Vice.</p>
<p>But you are also employed by these constitutional people, as
they call themselves?&mdash;Only in this one instance.</p>
<p>Were you employed to purchase the pamphlet in
question?&mdash;I purchased that and others.</p>
<p>You were employed by the Constitutional Society to purchase
them?&mdash;Yes, I was.</p>
<p>Who sent you?&mdash;Mr. Murray.</p>
<p>The Attorney?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>And he directed you to purchase this pamphlet, eh?&mdash;He
did not particularize any.</p>
<p>Did he state his object in the purchase?&mdash;No.</p>
<p>What wages are you to have?&mdash;I have no wages.</p>
<p>Then you perform this agreeable duty gratuitously?&mdash;No, I
do not say that.</p>
<p>Then how are you paid?&mdash;I made a charge for my time.</p>
<p>Perhaps you belong to the society?&mdash;No, indeed I do not
(with vehemence).</p>
<p>Well, I do not wonder that you should be anxious to separate
yourself from the society (a laugh amongst the auditory).</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gurney</span>.&mdash;I desire that no
such remarks may be made.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>.&mdash;What have you had
for this particular <!-- page 76--><a name="page76"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 76</span>job?&mdash;I have made a charge for
several other little things I did (a laugh).</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gurney</span> (to the
spectators),&mdash;I shall certainly move his Lordship to take
notice of some particular persons that I see misconducting
themselves.</p>
<p>Cross-examination resumed.&mdash;What other jobs did you for
the association?&mdash;I did several jobs; that I will not
deny.</p>
<p>How much have you had for these little jobs?&mdash;I declare
upon my oath, I cannot state particularly how much I had for
these little jobs.&nbsp; I made a charge.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
recollect exactly what my charge was.</p>
<p>Come, come, the round sum?&mdash;I can tell you pretty nearly
the round sum, if that will satisfy you.&nbsp; I think it was
above seven pounds and under seven guineas.&nbsp; I was sent on
other business beside this.</p>
<p>I wish to know what that other business was?&mdash;Is it
necessary to answer that question?</p>
<p>I think it necessary.&mdash;Then I will take the sense of the
Court upon it.&nbsp; I have no objection to answer that or any
other question, if my Lord thinks I ought.</p>
<p>Mr. Justice <span class="smcap">Best</span>
(smiling).&mdash;It tends to nothing; but it is as well to answer
it.</p>
<p>Then I purchased come other different things for the
association, but it was not in consequence of any general or
particular orders I received: I went to purchase these
publications which I myself thought libels; I cannot state
exactly now what they were.</p>
<p>Then you did that, I suppose, without any hope of
reward?&mdash;I don&rsquo;t state without any hope of reward; I
expected to be paid for my time.</p>
<p>Oh, then, it was not altogether out of virtue and patriotic
feeling?&mdash;Those were two of my motives, most certainly, but
not the only ones (general laughing).</p>
<p><!-- page 77--><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>Has this been the usual way of getting your
living?&mdash;It has for a year and a half past; I have had no
other feasible occupation during that time.</p>
<p>I suppose you received a considerable sum in the course of
this honourable employment?&mdash;I have told you the sum total
was about &pound;7.</p>
<p>Mr. Justice <span class="smcap">Best</span>.&mdash;Do you
think that material, Mr. Cooper?</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>.&mdash;I do think it
material, to show the sort of agents that this honourable society
employs.&nbsp; (To witness.)&nbsp; And what did you do before you
suppressed vice and libels?&mdash;I got my living honourably as
an officer in his Majesty&rsquo;s customs.</p>
<p>And are you still an honourable officer, &amp;c.?&mdash;No; I
have lost my situation.</p>
<p>Retired upon a pension?&mdash;No.</p>
<p>How old are you?&mdash;Fifty-four.</p>
<p>No pension, eh?&mdash;None.</p>
<p>Re-examined by Mr. <span class="smcap">Gurney</span>.&mdash;I
have been in the employment of the Society for the Suppression of
Vice for a year and a half; I have been paid by them for my
services.&nbsp; In this instance, and in several others, I have
made some purchases for the Constitutional Association.</p>
<p><i>Horatio Orton</i> was then called.&nbsp; A general murmur
ran through the Court, which was crowded to excess; and all
persons most deferentially gave the witness way.</p>
<p>Examined by Mr. <span class="smcap">Gurney</span>.&mdash;I was
a witness before the Grand Jury.&nbsp; On the 10th of March I
purchased another copy of the pamphlet in question from Mary Anne
Carlile; I had it from her own hand.</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. <span
class="smcap">Cooper</span>.&mdash;How came you to purchase this
on the 10th of March?&mdash;I was directed by Mr. Murray, the
solicitor, to purchase it.</p>
<p><!-- page 78--><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>This is the gentleman? (pointing to Mr. Murray, in
court)&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>He is the Honorary Secretary to the Association, and the
disinterested attorney for this prosecution?&mdash;Yes, I was
sent by him for the express purpose of purchasing this pamphlet;
I should not have gone if I had not been directed by him.</p>
<p>What is your situation in the society?&mdash;My situation to
the Association is as clerk.</p>
<p>Clerk to Mr. Murray?&mdash;No; I am not in Mr. Murray&rsquo;s
office.</p>
<p>In the Society&rsquo;s office, separate from the
attorney&rsquo;s office?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>In what situation were you before?&mdash;I used to assist my
brother in his correspondence with country newspapers.</p>
<p>Not for the town papers?&mdash;No, for himself; he takes the
reports of the House of Lords&rsquo; proceedings, and transmits
them to the editors of the country papers; I used to assist him
in the copying, and he paid me for my trouble.</p>
<p>What is your salary in your present honourable
situation?&mdash;It is not fixed.</p>
<p>It depends upon your exertions?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>Then you work at present by the piece?&mdash;No, I do not; the
committee have not yet come to a determination about my salary; I
have not made any demand for salary; I have not proposed any sum;
I mean to swear that; not any sum has been proposed to me; I
don&rsquo;t say that I would work for the Society gratuitously;
if I want five or ten pounds I know where to go for it; not of
the Association; I can have it of my brother; I expect to receive
something of the Association.</p>
<p>In your modesty, what may be the extent of your
expectations?</p>
<p><!-- page 79--><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gurney</span> submitted that
this was not a proper mode of cross-examination.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>.&mdash;I think it is,
and I shall persist in it until I am told by my Lord that it is
irregular.</p>
<p>Mr. Justice <span class="smcap">Best</span>.&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t think any part of the cross-examination is
approaching to anything like regularity.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>.&mdash;If your Lordship
says I am not to be allowed the same latitude which is allowed to
counsel on other occasions, I shall not persevere.</p>
<p>Mr. Justice <span class="smcap">Best</span>.&mdash;I have no
objection to your taking your own course, but I think this course
of examination ought to have been stopped long ago.&nbsp; I think
every fair and reasonable indulgence ought to be allowed to
counsel in such a case, but if this was a mere civil case I
should have stopped you long ago.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>.&mdash;Then I shall
proceed in my own way, with your Lordship&rsquo;s
permission.&nbsp; (To witness.)&nbsp; Is this the first job you
have been employed in?&mdash;I don&rsquo;t recollect any other of
this kind.</p>
<p>Are you sure you have been employed upon no other job of this
kind?&mdash;I cannot bring to my recollection whether I have not
been employed on any other.&nbsp; I may have been, but I am not
aware of any.</p>
<p>Do you know a man named King?&mdash;Yes, perfectly.</p>
<p>Do you recollect doing a job in which he was
concerned?&mdash;I don&rsquo;t recollect doing a job of this kind
against King.&nbsp; I might if I saw the paper before me with my
mark upon it.&nbsp; There are so many of them that I cannot
recollect any in particular.</p>
<p>Have you not made an affidavit in the job against
King?&mdash;Yes; but that is since this.&nbsp; I cannot recollect
whether I have done any other jobs.&nbsp; I have been in the
employment of the Association about six months.&nbsp; I <!-- page
80--><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>commenced on the 8th of January.&nbsp; Since the 10th of
March, I don&rsquo;t recollect how many jobs I have been engaged
in; they are so numerous I can&rsquo;t recollect.&nbsp; The
orders which Mr. Murray gave me, were to go and purchase the
Reformers&rsquo; Address at the defendant&rsquo;s shop.&nbsp; I
had not any general directions to buy at this or that
shop&mdash;not from Mr. Murray.&nbsp; I had from other persons,
general directions to make purchase of works; one of those
persons was Mr. Sharpe.</p>
<p>He is the Honorary Assistant Secretary?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>(All the preceding questions excited considerable sensations
amongst the audience, and produced a chorus of humourous
tittering).</p>
<p>Mr. Justice <span class="smcap">Best</span>.&mdash;The effect
of these questions, Mr. Cooper, you must feel.&nbsp; You cannot
wish, I am sure, to excite the sort of response which comes from
below the bar.&nbsp; You must see that it is done on
purpose.&nbsp; You cannot wish, I am sure, to produce that
effect.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>.&mdash;My Lord, I am the
last man in the world to do any thing inconsistent with the
gravity and decorum of a Court of Justice.&nbsp; I disclaim any
such intention; and I must disdain the insinuation of Mr. Gurney,
that I have taken up this cause for the purpose of adding to the
public odium in which the honourable Association is held.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gurney</span> said his learned friend,
Mr. Cooper, was mistaken; he had never insinuated anything of the
kind.</p>
<p>Mr. Justice <span class="smcap">Best</span>.&mdash;I am sure
no gentlemen at the bar would wish to produce the effect which
all the questions put by you have had below the bar.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cooper</span> said he could not
control the feelings of the auditory.&nbsp; He was only anxious
to do his duty to the best of his humble ability, and nothing
should deter him from discharging that duty freely and
undauntedly.</p>
<p><!-- page 81--><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>Cross-examination resumed.&mdash;What is the office of
the Honorary Assistant Secretary?&mdash;It is to do every thing
at the office.</p>
<p>To superintend the business of the office?&mdash;I consider
him as the acting manager.</p>
<p>Then the Honorary Secretary has a sinecure?&mdash;What does
the word honorary mean but a sinecure?</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>.&mdash;&ldquo;May it
please your Lordship; gentlemen of the jury; I am exceedingly
sorry that some more able counsel has not to address you on this
most important and momentous occasion.&nbsp; I should have been
unequal to the task, under any circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gurney</span>.&mdash;&ldquo;Stop a
minute.&rdquo;&nbsp; (The learned counsel for the prosecution
here intimated, that he had something to add to his case; but,
after a pause, he intimated to Mr. Cooper, that he might
proceed.)</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>.&mdash;Gentlemen, under
any circumstances, this would be a task, for which, I fear, I am
very ill qualified; but under those, in which I stand to address
you on this question, I feel my incapacity doubled and
trebled.&nbsp; I appear before you without notice, and almost
wholly without preparation.&nbsp; I was, indeed, applied to by
the defendant, some months ago, and negotiated with (if I may use
the phrase) to undertake her defence.&nbsp; But, after this, many
days and even weeks passed, during which I heard nothing of the
case; and I began to suppose that the defendant had determined to
employ some other counsel, or trust herself to her own address to
the jury against this charge.&nbsp; At the end of a month,
however, I was again applied to; and, again, weeks having
elapsed, without my hearing any more of this prosecution, I
dismissed it entirely, not only from my mind, but from my memory;
nor was it, till last night, that, that I was once more informed
that I was to be <!-- page 82--><a name="page82"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 82</span>employed as the defendant&rsquo;s
counsel; and my brief at last put into my hands.&nbsp; I was then
unfortunately engaged in other important business: and the time,
I have taken to collect my own thoughts upon this question, and
huddle together a few extract&rsquo;s from writers of authority,
I have been obliged to borrow from sleep; and have, therefore, in
a great measure counteracted myself; for I have lost in strength,
what I have gained in information, and appear before you ill
able, indeed, to do justice to this cause.&nbsp; But, whilst I
make this statement to excuse my own deficiency, I am bound to
acquit the defendant of any reproachable negligence of her own
interests.&nbsp; I understand, that the cause of her late
application to me, is, that having had, as a mere matter of
grace, three weeks&rsquo; notice of trial from another society,
by which she has been prosecuted, she mistook it for her right;
and expected the same notice from her present prosecutors.&nbsp;
As she had not received any such notice (and indeed she was not
in law entitled to it), she supposed, that either she was not to
be brought to trial at these sittings, or that the charge was
abandoned; as I wish it had been, and as it ought to have been;
for I am convinced, that this prosecution cannot be sustained by
either law or reason; and that it must be from the weakness of
the counsel alone, that you, gentlemen, can be betrayed to
pronounce a verdict of Guilty against the defendant.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, it is my duty to clear this case of every possible
prejudice that may hang about it in your minds before I enter
into the merits of my defence.&nbsp; I do not know how you are
affected, but I well know, that with many persons, I should have
a host of prejudices to contend against, in the very name alone
of Carlile.&nbsp; Many either believe, or affect to believe, that
the very sound is an omen and an execration, and that either he
cannot be <!-- page 83--><a name="page83"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 83</span>sincere and honest in the opinions
which he professes, or if he be, that those opinions are
incompatible with the existence or practice of any moral or
social virtue.&nbsp; But, whatever his opinions may be, and
whatever your sentiments upon them, I have at least a right to
ask of you not to allow any prejudice against the relation,
against the brother, to warp your judgment on the trial of the
defendant: for, what can possibly be more remote from justice,
than, instead of judging a person fairly for his own conduct, to
condemn him by our opinion of the sentiments and character of
another?&nbsp; I hope and trust that you have entertained no such
prejudices: but if you have, I feel assured, that you brought
them no further than the threshold of the court:&mdash;at that
door they fell from you, like the burthen from the pilgrim (in
the beautiful allegory) on his reaching the cross; and you stand
there with your minds unbiassed, free and pure, to decide between
the crown and the defendant in this cause.&nbsp; But it is not
only my duty, gentlemen, to clear the defendant, but to extricate
the counsel from every unfavourable suspicion, lest it should,
possibly, by any confusion of the client with the advocate,
operate to the disadvantage of the defendant.</p>
<p>Whatever, therefore, may be thought of the pamphlet which is
before you, as a libel, or of the writer or publisher, I most
solemnly affirm, that there is no one who more warmly admires the
English constitution, as it stands in theory and ought to exist
in practice, than myself, nor is there any one who would more
willingly shed his blood if it were necessary, or even lose his
life in its support.&nbsp; It is needless then to say, that a
more irreconcileable enemy would not be found than myself to the
man (if any such there be) who could attempt to overturn <!--
page 84--><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
84</span>our mingled and limited forms of government: and
substitute a wild democracy in their place.&nbsp; I think,
indeed, that a democratic form of government, however specious in
argument, is by no means so capable of raising a state to that
eminence of civilization and prosperity, which this country has
reached; a condition, for which it is indebted to better times,
while the practice concurred with the theory of our government;
but which, unless the practice is brought back to the theory, I
venture to predict, has not much longer to continue.&nbsp; I,
gentlemen, appear here only in the discharge of my duty; and to
redeem that pledge to defend the accused, which every man, upon
assuming this gown, gives to the public of England.&nbsp; I
would, however, have it distinctly understood, that it is only to
guard against prejudice to the defendant, and not from any
apprehensions for myself, that I trouble you with this
explanation.&nbsp; For myself, I am extremely careless, what may
be thought of me for having come forward to defend this
unfortunate woman.&nbsp; I do not expect to escape obloquy in the
present overheated disposition of the country, How can I expect
it? when even the present Lord Erskine, whose talents and
independence should have rendered his character sacred, as soon
as it was known that he was to be counsel for Paine was
overwhelmed with abuse, and threatened with the loss of his
situation, as attorney general to the Prince, if he did not
decline the defence.&nbsp; But he knew his duty and discharged
it.&nbsp; And for which will he be most honoured by
posterity?&nbsp; By which most ennobled? for having in spite of
threats, and all the seductions of self-interest, persevered in
his duty? or for having been exalted to the peerage of England
and adorned with the national order of Scotch knighthood?&nbsp;
But, if even my humble situation, should not exempt me from the
attacks of the malicious and furious, <!-- page 85--><a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>I can tell
them that their malignity will be disappointed.&nbsp; Instead of
regret and mortification it will be a source of pride and
happiness to me.&nbsp; Small as my chance may be of credit for
the assertion, I declare, that I propose to myself no reward so
high for my exertions, as the consciousness of having, in spite
of all hopes on one side, or fears on the other, honestly
discharged my duty.</p>
<p>If ever in my course in the profession, I should find myself
wounded either in fortune or reputation, instead of regretting
and deploring it, I will rejoice and exult at it, and, at those
hours, when in full confidence of his companions, it is neither
indecent nor unsafe in a man to speak of his own actions, I will
boast of it, I will shew it, as an honourable scar.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, with these preliminary observations, I will proceed
to introduce my case to you.&nbsp; My learned friend, Mr. Gurney,
has opened this prosecution with all that pomp of eloquence, and
solemnity of declamation, which he possesses in so ample a
manner, and which make him so accomplished an advocate.&nbsp; But
what has he done?&nbsp; All, indeed, that he or any one else
could have done: yet, nothing more than repeat those arguments,
which are trite, and worn like a turnpike, and have been topics
for counsel after counsel, through a thousand of these
prosecutions; while he has left all the great subjects of
consideration that present themselves to the mind on these
questions, wholly untouched.&nbsp; He has declared, indeed, but
without showing you why, that the words, charged in the
indictment are an atrocious libel; in which, as it appears to me,
he has been rather premature, for a libel they are not, and
cannot be, unless your verdict should so declare them.&nbsp; I
assert, gentlemen, I am sure his Lordship will nod assent to me
while I assert it, that you are the only <!-- page 86--><a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>judges of the
law of libel in this case; and this paper, for which the
defendant stands before you, is either a libel or not a libel, as
you may in your consciences think it, and on your oaths pronounce
it.</p>
<p>The statute, indeed, which declares this the law, has given,
or rather left with his Lordship, the right of stating his
opinion on that question to you; but I am sure he will not think
that I exceed my duty, as an advocate, when I say, that though it
is your duty to receive his opinion with respect, and give it the
most attentive consideration, yet it still leaves you free to
your own judgments, and if after weighing his opinion, you find
yours unaltered, you have not only a right, but it is your duty
to reject his opinion and to act on your own.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I submit that it is within your province to take
into consideration the nature and operation of those writings,
which are called in prosecutions of this kind libels.&nbsp; You
are sitting there to try this charge as an offence by the common
law of the land.&nbsp; The defendant is accused of having
committed an act in the nature of a nuisance; and you are to
judge whether that act could operate as a nuisance or not.&nbsp;
You are not bound, because pamphlets have been prosecuted as
libels time out of mind, or even because they have been declared
libels by the verdicts of preceding juries to tread in no other
path than their steps; and to find similar, or even the same
matter, libels, if you should not think them criminal or
dangerous.&nbsp; If you should be convinced by argument, not only
that the pamphlet before you is not a libel, but that almost all
those political writings, which it has been the habit of certain
people, taking up the cry from their leaders, to call libels, are
not merely not dangerous but beneficial to political society; is
it possible to conceive, that you can <!-- page 87--><a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>be induced to
pronounce a verdict of guilty against the defendant!&nbsp; How
can you come to such a conclusion; as that there should be
punishment where there has been no mischief, and where there
could have been none, and if there not only has been no mischief,
but could have been none,&mdash;nay, if even there must have been
benefit, how can you lay your hands on your hearts, and say there
has been crime?&nbsp; Suppose a man was indicted for a nuisance
in doing that for which a number of persons had in succession
been indicted and convicted, would that oblige a jury to find a
verdict against a person at this day indicted for the same act,
if he should prove to them by evidence, which their minds could
not resist, that what had been complained of as hurtful to public
health and morals was noxious to neither, but salutary to
both?&nbsp; Would you, in such a case, though a thousand
preceding juries had, in their ignorance, pronounced verdicts of
guilty, follow their example, against your full knowledge and
internal conscience?&nbsp; To illustrate by a familiar instance,
when hops were first introduced into this country they were very
generally believed to be pernicious.&nbsp; Several persons were I
believe prosecuted and convicted for using them; yet now they are
known not only to be not pernicious, but nutritious; they form a
principal ingredient in the daily beverage of our tables, and are
even employed largely in medicine.&nbsp; Let us now imagine a man
prosecuted for the use of hops or any other drugs upon the ground
that they injured health, and that upon his trial he should fill
the box with men of science as witnesses, and shew you to moral
demonstration, that so far from being injurious, they were highly
salutary, would you, because other juries had convicted in a
state of ignorance, imitate their blindness, and convict the
defendant?&nbsp; Certainly not.&nbsp; Then to apply <!-- page
88--><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>this
to writings, prosecuted as libels, though there may have been
hundreds, and thousands, nay tens of thousands of convictions
upon them, yet, if you should be convinced, that what are usually
called libels (and this among them) cannot be injurious, but so
far from it, that they are innocent and even salutary to the
state, in which they are published, would you hand over the
publisher to punishment by a verdict of guilty?&nbsp; But I am
anticipating, I fear, my defence, and introducing too early
observations, which will better be urged in a subsequent part of
my address to you.&nbsp; I will, therefore, pass at once to the
paper charged as a libel in the indictment, and examine, under
what circumstances it has come before you.&nbsp; And in the first
place, as to the publication, without which (whatever the nature
of the writing may be, there can be no crime) who are morally the
publishers of this pamphlet?&nbsp; Have you any evidence,
whatever, that any one of these pamphlets was in circulation, or
ever would have been circulated, but for the impertinent,
obtrusive, sordid, and base part of the ministers of the
Constitutional Association?&nbsp; How otherwise is this pamphlet
here?&nbsp; Let us turn back to the evidence of the first
witness.&nbsp; He was the worthy servant of the Association in
this and a few other recent instances, but for the most part,
within a year and a half, the servant of the Society for the
Suppression of Vice: a Society very different, indeed, from that
with which we have had to deal to-day;&mdash;not that I have any
affection even for that association: I would neither praise nor
even be suspected of approving it, but I will not be so unjust
and scandalous as to compare it with the Constitutional
Association.&nbsp; Before this witness was employed by that
society, he was a Custom-house officer.&nbsp; Are you, I asked
him, now a Custom-house officer?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; How comes
that?&nbsp; I lost <!-- page 89--><a name="page89"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>my place.&nbsp; How old are
you?&nbsp; Fifty-four.&nbsp; Have you any pension?&nbsp;
No.&nbsp; Now, gentlemen, I beg to observe, that it is not the
habit of the Custom-house to turn away officers, who have grown
grey in their service, without a pension; unless they have richly
deserved to be so discarded and abandoned.&nbsp; Such, gentlemen,
are the instruments employed as spies by the acting members of
this Association!&nbsp; This fellow is sent out with instructions
from the honorary secretary, Mr. Murray, who is the attorney for
the prosecution, to purchase, not this pamphlet alone, but any
political pamphlet, which in his judgment might be
libelous.&nbsp; Good God! to what a condition are we reduced,
when, under the auspices of this blessed Association, discarded
tide-waiters, and broken gaugers, are made judges of what is
libelous, and leagued with an attorney, are to determine what
may, and what may not, without the terror of a prosecution, issue
from a free press.&nbsp; Such was the course pursued: and can you
conscientiously say, that, but for this hiring of a spy to make a
purchase of this pamphlet for the sole purpose of founding this
prosecution upon that very instance of sale, the public would
ever have heard of it?&nbsp; Gentlemen, it is a great happiness,
and much security arises from it, that every person who stands
forward as a prosecutor exposes his own conduct, as it is
connected with the prosecution, to scrutiny and
animadversion.&nbsp; I have a right to assume that freedom which
is the privilege of the bar.&nbsp; I remember that in the case of
the King and the Dean of St. Asaph, in which the present Marshal
of the King&rsquo;s Bench Prison, without any apparent connection
with the subject of the prosecution, was the prosecutor, the
counsel for the defendant exercised this right, and the Marshal
was successively the object of his ridicule and indignation.</p>
<p><!-- page 90--><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>Mr. Justice <span class="smcap">Best</span>.&mdash;Mr.
Cooper do you think it acting fairly to make this sort of attack
on a gentleman who is not present?&nbsp; Is this the practice of
the bar?</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>.&mdash;My Lord, I make
no attack on the Marshal.&nbsp; I only state that&mdash;</p>
<p>Mr. Justice <span class="smcap">Best</span>.&mdash;These
observations being made on one who is not anywise connected with
this case, who is not present to answer for himself, and who
would not be permitted if he was, what are we to suppose?&nbsp;
Can any gentleman at the bar consider this as fair?</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>.&mdash;My Lord, I have
no design to attack the Marshal either in his absence or
presence.&nbsp; I mentioned him but incidentally.&nbsp; What
earthly purpose could it answer to this case to attack him?&nbsp;
He <i>was</i> the prosecutor in <i>that</i> case, and I rather
incautiously, perhaps, mentioned who the prosecutor was, by name;
when I ought only to have said the prosecutor.&nbsp; If I have
done him any injustice, I beg his pardon as publicly for it, and
thus, I give a remedy as wide as the wound.&nbsp; I say then,
gentlemen, that the prosecutor in that case, was alternately the
object of the keenest indignation, and the most jeering ridicule,
and I have a right to be equally as free, as the counsel in that
case, with the prosecutors in this: but I shall by no means
follow the example.&nbsp; On the contrary, I think, we are deeply
indebted to the Constitutional Association.&nbsp; Consider how we
were circumstanced when they first arose amongst us.&nbsp; There
was the state, with a standing army of only a hundred thousand
men, and nothing besides, except the whole civil force of the
realm, a revenue of no more than seventy millions; and the feeble
assistance of the established law officers of the crown to
prosecute public offenders, when this Constitutional Association
in the pure spirit of chivalry, steps forward to help the
weakness of <!-- page 91--><a name="page91"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 91</span>Government, and succour its
distress.&nbsp; Now, whatever men may talk of justice, who can
say that disinterestedness has altogether abandoned the
earth?&nbsp; Who can say that generosity has forsaken us and
flown to heaven?&nbsp; Let it be considered too, that but for
their active vigilance Carlile&rsquo;s shop would not have been
known.&nbsp; No productions from it had ever been the subject of
prosecution, and but for the keen scent of the Association, the
rank and huge sedition contained in the New Year&rsquo;s Address
might have lain in its covert undetected and undisturbed.&nbsp;
But to drop this irony and be serious, the law officers of the
crown are fully adequate to their duties, and Carlile&rsquo;s
shop was as well known to the Attorney General as St.
Paul&rsquo;s to you.&nbsp; For years he has not had his eyes off
it.&nbsp; I will engage that every publication, that has issued
from it, and this very pamphlet among the rest, has passed
through his hands, and under his review.&nbsp; Yet the law
officers of the crown do not appear here to prosecute it as a
libel against the state; and I entreat you to mark this, for I
have a right to urge it, as a strong negative proof, that they do
not so consider it; and how can that require your condemnation
which they (with a judgment surely very much superior to that of
the Committee of the Constitutional Association) have not thought
worthy of prosecution or notice?&nbsp; Yes, you are actually
called upon by this Association to deliver over to punishment the
publisher of this paper, whilst the law officers of the crown
(who neglect their duty, if they do not prosecute offences
against the state) have thought it of a nature not at all
requiring their interference What can be so preposterous?&nbsp;
So monstrous?&nbsp; And in taking leave of this view of the case,
let me once more ask you who have been actually the publishers of
this paper?&nbsp; Have you a single iota of <!-- page 92--><a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>evidence,
which ought to satisfy your minds, that, but for the insidious
conduct of the Association, and its spies, this pamphlet would
ever have been before you or the public?&nbsp; Is there a shadow
of proof that one copy was ever sold, except those bought by the
creatures employed by the honorary secretary (who is also the
feed attorney in this prosecution) for the sole object of
entangling the defendant in this indictment?&nbsp; None,
whatever.&nbsp; None.&nbsp; They conspired you see to procure and
seduce (the word is neither too broad nor too long for their
conduct) the publication for the very purpose of this
prosecution.&nbsp; How then having thus suborned the offence of
which they complain, can they dare to stand forward as
prosecutors, when they themselves are the criminals, and ought to
be the defendants.</p>
<p>Mr. Justice <span class="smcap">Best</span>.&mdash;You
mean.&nbsp; Mr. Cooper, to offer some evidence of that, I
suppose.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>.&mdash;None, my lord,
but the evidence already before the court and the jury, and the
strong and necessary inference from the facts proved by the
witnesses for the prosecution themselves.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gurney</span>.&mdash;There were many
others lying on the counter.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>.&mdash;What of that,
does it follow that they must, therefore, have been sold?&nbsp;
In the absence of all other proof of any publication, I have a
right, I am forced to consider the Association as the only
publishers.</p>
<p>Mr. Justice <span class="smcap">Best</span>.&mdash;In the
evidence there is nothing like it.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>.&mdash;What, gentlemen,
is it a necessary conclusion, that because the pamphlets were
lying in the shop, they must have been sold to other
persons?&nbsp; The defendant but for their intrusion, for the
sole design of <!-- page 93--><a name="page93"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 93</span>prosecution, might have sold no
others.&nbsp; She might have changed her intention to sell.&nbsp;
The pamphlets might have lain like bad verses untouched on the
shop counter, till they were turned over for waste paper, and not
a soul have ever known of their contents.&nbsp; The Association,
therefore, by their insidious and plotted purchase for the sole
object of prosecution, have provoked the act of publication, and
they, who provoke crimes are the criminals, and ought to be the
culprits; and those, who would punish the crimes that they have
provoked, are devils, and not men; &ldquo;the tempters ere the
accusers.&rdquo;&nbsp; When I contemplate such conduct&mdash;but
I will not waste another word, or another moment of your time
upon this miserable Association.&nbsp; If I had consulted my
better judgment, I should have passed them in silence; thus much
my indignation has wrung from my contempt.</p>
<p>I shall now, gentlemen, proceed to the examination of the
libel, or rather that which is charged as a libel itself; and I
shall begin with the last part so charged in the indictment,
instead (as my learned friend has done) with the first; and let
me beg your regard to one remarkable fact, that at the very point
of the paper, at which the motives, and design of the writer
present themselves to the reader; at that very point this
indictment stops.&nbsp; It has not, as you will presently see,
the candour to proceed a single syllable farther.&nbsp; I will
now read the passage, &ldquo;Reform,&rdquo; it says, &ldquo;will
be obtained when the existing authorities have no longer the
power to withhold it, and not before, we shall gain it as early
without petitioning as with it; and I would again put forward my
opinion that something more than a petitioning attitude is
necessary.&rdquo;&nbsp; This it has been urged to you, with great
emphasis, is an excitement to insurrection; and you are called
upon to <!-- page 94--><a name="page94"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 94</span>draw that inference, though the
author immediately afterwards disavows, expressly disavows any
such intention.&nbsp; But even, if the words stood alone, I deny
that you are compelled to such a construction.&nbsp; Gentlemen,
will any one venture to say, that I, standing in this place, and
in the very exercise of my profession, mean any thing, but what
is strictly legal, when I say myself, that supposing reform in
Parliament be necessary, something more than mere petitioning is
requisite to obtain it?&nbsp; But in saying this, do I mean any
thing violent or illegal?&nbsp; Heaven forbid; No: but I would
have societies formed, and meetings held for the purpose of
discussing that momentous subject.&nbsp; If reform be necessary,
and the desire of a great majority of the country, I would have
that desire shown unambiguously to the legislature, by
resolutions and declarations at such meetings.&nbsp; Who will
deny such societies and meetings to be legal?&nbsp; Yet, such
meetings would be more than mere petitioning, much more: and the
author means nothing beyond this; for I say, that in the absence
of all other criteria, the only means of judging of a
writer&rsquo;s intentions are his words.&nbsp; Look then at the
words which immediately follow the assertion, that
&ldquo;something more than a petitioning attitude is
necessary.&rdquo;&nbsp; If those words had been included in the
indictment, this prosecution must have been at an end upon merely
reading the charge, and those words, therefore, the Association
avoided, as cautiously as they would the poison of a viper.&nbsp;
They felt, that though the indicted words standing alone might
perhaps admit of a doubt for a moment, yet the context completely
explained them, and gave an air of perfect innocence to the whole
passage.&nbsp; But you shall judge for yourselves: I will read
the passage,&mdash;&ldquo;Something more than a <!-- page 95--><a
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>petitioning
attitude is necessary.&nbsp; At this moment I would not say a
word about insurrection; but I would strongly recommend union,
activity, and co-operation.&nbsp; Be ready and steady to meet any
concurrent circumstance.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now what kind of union,
activity, and co-operation does he mean?&nbsp; Is it military
association, marches, and attack?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Hear the
writer&rsquo;s own words again:&mdash;&ldquo;The Union Rooms at
Manchester and Stockport are admirable models of co-operation,
and are more calculated than any thing else to strengthen the
body of reformers.&rdquo;&nbsp; For what do the reformers
assemble in these rooms?&nbsp; How do they co-operate
there?&nbsp; Is it to consult how they shall arm and organize
themselves, and seize with a violent hand the reform which they
despair of gaining by petition?&nbsp; Nothing like it.&nbsp; The
writer himself still tells you his meaning.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here
(that is at the Manchester and Stockport rooms) children are
educated, and adults instruct each other.&nbsp; Here there is a
continual and frequent communication between all the reformers in
those towns.&rdquo;&nbsp; This, then, and no other, is the
co-operation which the author intended, and proposes.&nbsp; If
any man, taking the paper in his hand and reading the whole
paragraph, can say that any thing more is meant, to his reason I
should cease to appeal.&nbsp; I should sit down in silent despair
of making any impression on such an understanding; but you,
gentlemen, I ask you, adding the words which I have read to the
broken passage, which is insidiously separated and included in
the indictment, can there be a doubt remaining in any rational
and unprejudiced mind, that the union and co-operation called for
by this Address from those who desire reform in Parliament, is
nothing more than the establishment at other places, of rooms, on
the model of those at Stockport and Manchester; <!-- page 96--><a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>where
children and adults are instructed, and information disseminated
on the subject of Parliamentary Reform.&nbsp; And if this is all
that is meant, there is an end of this part of the indictment;
for it cannot be libelous to recommend in a writing the people to
do that, which it is perfectly legal to do.</p>
<p>With regard to reform itself, I cannot know, whether any of
you are advocates for it or opposed to it, nor is it requisite
that I should; I do not ask you to think or say with me, and
others, that reform in Parliament is necessary, and that nothing
but reform can save the country from ruin; all that I ask of you
is to allow me and others credit for the conscientiousness of our
opinions, and charitably admit, if yours are opposite, that
though we may be mistaken in our judgments, we must not of
necessity be criminal in our intentions.&nbsp; I leave you and
every man to the free exercise of your thoughts, and the free
enjoyment of the conclusions to which they lead you.&nbsp; Let
this liberality be reciprocal, and concede the same freedom to
others which you demand for yourselves.&nbsp; I have always
thought that a difference in religious and political matters need
not and ought not to create hostility of feeling, and sever
those, who would otherwise be friends.&nbsp; I myself enjoy the
friendship of several, who entertain very different opinions from
mine upon those subjects; and yet that difference has not, and
never shall, on my part, at least, disturb our friendship.&nbsp;
In all questions in which you cannot have mathematical
demonstration, there may be fair, honest, conscientious
difference of opinion; and you cannot have geometrical proof in
questions of religion, politics, and morals.&nbsp; The very
nature of the subjects altogether excludes it.&nbsp; To expect
it, as Bishop Sanderson says, would be as absurd as to expect to
see with the ear <!-- page 97--><a name="page97"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 97</span>and to hear with the eye.&nbsp; So
various are our opinions upon these subjects, that we not only
differ from one another upon them, but at different times we find
we differ from ourselves; and, as another learned churchman, in
more recent times, has said, what could be more unjust than to
quarrel with other men for differing in opinion from him, when no
two men ever differed more from one another than he at different
times differed on the very same subject from himself.&nbsp; Under
this state of uncertainty in human judgment, I call upon you, and
I am sure I shall not call in vain, to be slow to condemn the
opinions of others, because they are different from your own;
and, therefore, if any of you should think reform in Parliament
needless, or even dangerous, I still call upon you (though the
writer of this paper should be a reformer, and even though he is
called in reproach a radical reformer) not to condemn the
defendant in this case through prejudice against the
author&rsquo;s opinions; but solely to enquire (be those opinions
ever so just or ever so absurd) whether he is sincere in
entertaining them; for, if he be (as I shall show you presently
from the highest authority) the law does not consider him
criminal.&nbsp; Try him by this test, and this test, and this
alone; and then, whatever may be your verdict, you will be free
from reproach, and secure to yourselves quiet by day, and sound
slumbers by night; for you will have discharged your duty to
yourselves, to the defendant, and to the country.</p>
<p>With regard, gentlemen, to the other part of the alleged
libel, I must bespeak your patience; for I am afraid that I shall
be drawn by my comments upon it into considerable length.&nbsp;
(I am afraid, gentlemen, I weary you, and I am sorry for
it.&nbsp; If I had had leisure, I would have condensed my
observations; but, under the circumstances I have <!-- page
98--><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>disclosed to you, I hope you will forgive me for
occupying more of your attention than I would otherwise have
done.&nbsp; I really have not had time to be short.)&nbsp; To
return to the passage in the paper, which is first charged as a
libel: it denies the existence of any constitution in Great
Britain.&nbsp; Now whether there be anything malicious and
criminal in this, depends entirely upon the meaning which the
author attaches to the word constitution.&nbsp; I confess it is a
word that gives me a very indistinct and uncertain idea; and I
believe that if any of you were now suddenly to ask yourselves
what you understood by it, you would find you were not very ready
to give yourselves an answer; and if you could even
satisfactorily answer yourselves, you would find if you were to
go further and question your neighbour, that he would give you a
very different definition from your own.&nbsp; In itself it means
nothing more than simply a standing or placing together; and it
really seems to me rather hard and venturous to indict a man for
denying the existence of something (whatever it may be) expressed
by the most indefinite term in our whole language.&nbsp; But, if
we were agreed upon the ideas which should be attached to the
word, let us examine whether, allowing for a certain freedom of
expression and the earnest eagerness with which a man who is
sincere in his doctrines enforces them in his composition, a
writer may not, without being exposed to a charge of criminal
intention, assert that there is no constitution in this
country.&nbsp; And let us take with us to this examination, that
a man is not to be too strictly tied to words, when under the
impulse of warm and keen feelings, and when the thoughts flow, as
it were, at once from the heart into the pen, he sits down to
excite his countrymen to their good, or warn them of their
danger.&nbsp; You must not think to bind him down with the
shackles <!-- page 99--><a name="page99"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 99</span>of verbal criticism, when he is too
intent upon his theme exactly to measure his expressions.&nbsp;
Now, that the writer of this paper is sincere in his opinions,
whatever the quality of those opinions is, it is difficult not to
believe.&nbsp; He published his opinions, though he exposed
himself to punishment for them, and he perseveres in them while
he is suffering a heavy punishment.&nbsp; You can have no more
convincing proof of sincerity than this.&nbsp; But, what if a
political writer has, in the warmth of composition, asserted that
in England we have no constitution, who can misunderstand
him?&nbsp; We cannot suppose he meant that there was a
dissolution of all law and government; because we know and feel
the contrary.&nbsp; Few would have occasion to ask him what he
meant.&nbsp; If, however, he were asked, he should explain by
telling you, that the constitution in theory is very much
corrupted from the practice; and I and you, and every person must
admit, that the practice has strayed wide from the theory; and,
forced to admit this, I assert with a writer, who (whatever was
thought of him once, and whilst those who were the objects of his
reproach still lived) is now the pride and boast of the country,
both for the supreme elegance and the principles of his political
writings, that &ldquo;wherever the practice deviates from the
theory so far the practice is vicious and corrupt.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Now, saying no more than this, and when it would have been the
merest stupidity to understand him literally, how can the writer
be convicted of a design to bring the Government into hatred and
contempt, because he has expressed his meaning by saying
figuratively &ldquo;there is no Constitution.&rdquo;&nbsp; But he
has previously said, that to talk about the British Constitution
is, in his opinion, dishonesty.&nbsp; I know he has.&nbsp; I did
not mean to pass it, I will not, gentlemen, shrink from any part
of <!-- page 100--><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>the passage, for I feel that it cannot bear with any
heavy pressure against me.&nbsp; &ldquo;To talk of the British
Constitution is, in my opinion, a sure proof of
dishonesty.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here it will be seen that the only
exception that can be taken to this sentence is the mere mode of
expression.&nbsp; If a man were to talk to me of the Constitution
of England, and, by omitting all notice of its aberrations in
practice from its theory, by which he would leave it free to me
to suspect, that he would insinuate that the theory and the
practice were the same, I should certainly say, that he was
exhibiting want of candour.&nbsp; I might, perhaps, think
dishonesty, rather too strong a term for such conduct; but I
should not scruple to say, that he was disingenuous, and he
<i>would</i> be guilty of a species of dishonesty; for all the
disingenuousness is to a degree dishonest; and, since the meaning
is the same, why should we quarrel at a mere difference of
expression?&nbsp; The author proceeds to say, &ldquo;If we speak
of the Spanish Constitution, we have something tangible; there is
a substance and meaning as well as sound.&rdquo;&nbsp; So that it
is clear he was saying, that we had no Constitution in comparison
with that just promulged by the Spanish nation.&nbsp; The
Spaniards we know have recently gained by their own glorious
efforts, that political liberty to which they had been so long
strangers; and their Legislature had just published a code of
fundamental laws, few in number, but most comprehensive in
securing freedom to the people, for whom they are framed.&nbsp;
They are (comparatively with the laws of countries, in which the
frame of government is old, and complicated) not numerous, but
the mind may collect them almost at a glance, and possess itself
of them with a single effort of the understanding.&nbsp; In this
view of the subject, without doubt, the Constitution of Spain is
tangible; and in this sense he is <!-- page 101--><a
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>justified
in asserting that our own Constitution is not tangible; for is it
not notorious that our laws are spread through so many Acts of
Parliament of doubtful and difficult construction, and so many
books of reports, containing the common law of the land (and in
which there are no few conflicting decisions) that the whole life
of a man does not suffice to achieve a knowledge of them.&nbsp;
So multifarious and infinite and perplexed is our code, that even
amongst those whose profession is the law it is not possible to
meet with an accomplished lawyer.</p>
<p>The defendant here fainted, and was taken out of court.&nbsp;
After the interruption which this circumstance occasioned had
subsided, Mr. <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>
proceeded&mdash;</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I lament in common with many others that this evil
has attended an extended degree of civilization and
trade&mdash;that our laws have become too numerous and
complicated for the capacity of the mind.&nbsp; That they are so,
is not my opinion alone, but that of the Legislature
itself.&nbsp; I believe that a committee of the Houses of
Parliament has been sitting and still sits for the object of
reducing our laws to some limit in their number and some order as
to their design; without which our Constitution, to use the words
of the writer, cannot be tangible; a tangible shape, at present
it does not possess, for that cannot be tangible which spreads
itself over a boundless extent, that eludes, and defies the grasp
of the human intellect.</p>
<p>Having disposed of thus much of this paragraph, I come to the
words, on which my learned friend, Mr. Gurney, laid such extreme
stress in his address to you.&nbsp; &ldquo;Our very laws, are
corrupt and partial both in themselves, and in their
administration.&nbsp; In fact corruption <i>as notorious as the
sun at noon-day</i> is an avowed part of the system, and is
denominated the necessary oil for the wheels of Government.&nbsp;
<!-- page 102--><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
102</span>It is a most pernicious oil to the interests of the
people.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is strong language I admit, and would
perhaps be censurable as imprudent, at least, if the very
expressions themselves, which the writer uses, did not guide us
directly to the facts to which he alludes, and explain the
passage.&nbsp; He alludes most manifestly to the celebrated
exclamation of a person at the time that he was in the seat of
office, the first commoner of the realm, and who instead of being
reproached for his words has retired from his office with the
honours which he has merited for his services in it.&nbsp; It
transpired in the House of Commons, that seats had been
trafficked for as articles of sale and purchase for money.</p>
<p>Mr. Justice <span class="smcap">Best</span>.&mdash;Is that a
subject at all relating to the question which is now before the
jury?</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>.&mdash;My Lord, I am
going to use the declaration of the Speaker, as a matter of
history, and to show, that the words charged as criminal were an
allusion to it; and if so, were not criminally used.&nbsp; I do
not wish, nay I would avoid the introduction of any improper or
inflammatory topics.&nbsp; I would not attempt to serve my client
by such means.&nbsp; When it was exposed, that there had been
certain trafficking for seats in the House of Commons, the
Speaker used these words (and it is to them, I would show the
jury, the writer of the paper alludes), &ldquo;practices are as
notorious as the sun at noon-day at which our ancestors would
have started with indignation,&rdquo; and that
gentlemen&mdash;</p>
<p>Mr. Justice <span class="smcap">Best</span>.&mdash;Will you
allow me to ask you Mr. Cooper, I want to know where you get that
from.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>.&mdash;My Lord, from all
the reports of the speeches in the newspapers of the day which
were never contradicted.</p>
<p>Mr. Justice <span class="smcap">Best</span>.&mdash;I beg to
state, that, whatever passed in Parliament, cannot be questioned
anywhere else.&nbsp; Whatever <!-- page 103--><a
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>the Speaker
said in Parliament, he was justified in saying.&nbsp; But I have
no means of knowing, nor have you, whether he ever did say so or
not.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>.&mdash;I am not
questioning anything he said in the House of Commons&mdash;</p>
<p>Mr. Justice <span class="smcap">Best</span>.&mdash;If Mr.
Abbot had said it any where else, it would have been a libel on
the constitution; if he said it there, we cannot enquire about
it; it would be a breach of privilege.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>.&mdash;Your Lordship
asked me, how I came to know that he said so.&nbsp; My Lord, I
have seen it in all the recorded speeches of the House of Commons
in the published debates in Parliament, and&mdash;</p>
<p>Mr. Justice <span class="smcap">Best</span>.&mdash;I say there
are no recorded speeches of the House of Commons to which we can
listen or attend.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>.&mdash;Certainly, there
are no records of speeches in the House of Commons in the sense
in which the proceedings of courts of law are records, nor is
there in that sense any recorded speech of Cicero or of Lord
Chatham; but, my lord, will your lordship say, that I am not
entitled in my address to the jury to use that which has been
reported as part of a speech of Lord Chatham or of Cicero;
because there are no records filed, as in the courts of law, of
their speeches!&nbsp; I submit that they are matters of history;
and that, as such, I am at liberty to use them.</p>
<p>Mr. Justice <span class="smcap">Best</span>.&mdash;I tell you,
Mr. Cooper, what the distinction is.&nbsp; If you publish, that,
which may be said to be a speech of Lord Chatham&rsquo;s, and it
may be an accurate report of his speech, you may be guilty of
publishing a libel, though the place, in which that speech was
delivered gave a liberty to the speech.&nbsp; You know it has
been so decided in my Lord Abingdon&rsquo;s case, who published
his own speeches.</p>
<p><!-- page 104--><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>.&mdash;That, my
Lord, was a libel upon a private individual.&nbsp; I
say&mdash;</p>
<p>Mr. Justice <span class="smcap">Best</span>.&mdash;I say you
have no knowledge of anything which is said in the Houses of
Parliament.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>.&mdash;With great
submission I re-urge it as a matter of history, and as such I
would use it whether the fact is ten years old or ten thousand, I
submit makes no difference.</p>
<p>Mr. Justice <span class="smcap">Best</span>.&mdash;Mr. Cooper,
I have told you my opinion; if you don&rsquo;t choose to submit
to it, the best way will be to go on, perhaps.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>.&mdash;With the utmost
deference to your Lordship&mdash;</p>
<p>Mr. Justice <span class="smcap">Best</span>.&mdash;The Court
of King&rsquo;s Bench has decided this very point, within the
last two terms, against what you are contending for.&nbsp; If
your own opinion be the better one, proceed.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>.&mdash;Gentlemen, I was
going to say, when the Speaker of the House of Commons exclaimed
(I will not repeat particularly upon what occasion) that our
ancestors would have started with indignation at practices which
were &ldquo;as notorious as the sun at noon-day,&rdquo; can you
have any doubt in your mind that the writer of this pamphlet
alluded to that exclamation?&nbsp; Why look at the passage, see,
he uses the same words.&nbsp; &ldquo;Corruption is as notorious
as the sun at noon-day&rdquo; is his very expression.&nbsp; He is
citing the Speaker&rsquo;s own words, and cannot but be supposed
to be speaking of the very same facts.&nbsp; It was proposed, on
that occasion, to impeach a nobleman, whom I will not name and
need not, for those practices.&nbsp; This however was resisted by
almost all, and even by some who were friendly to Parliamentary
reform, and politically adverse to the noblemen, to whom I
allude, <!-- page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 105</span>not, indeed, upon any pretext of his
innocence of the practices, charged against him; but on the sole
ground that those practices were so general and notorious that
they would condemn themselves in sentencing him; and among so
many guilty, it would be unjust to single him alone for
punishment.&nbsp; Yes; although they were practices, at which our
ancestors would have started with indignation, they were the
practices of numbers, and the practices were as notorious as the
sun at noon-day; and, therefore, the proposition of impeachment
was rejected, and rightly; for as it has been said by the first
speaker of all antiquity, we cannot call men to a strict account
for their actions, while we are infirm in our own conduct.&nbsp;
If this is the state of one branch of our Legislature, and if it
is avowed, and by those who would conceal it, if concealment were
possible (but it would be as easy to conceal the sun).&nbsp; Good
God! shall a man be prosecuted and pronounced guilty, and
consigned to punishment for affirming that our laws are corrupt;
that there is corruption in the system, and that corruption is an
avowed part of that system? when in so affirming he only echoes
the exclamation of the Speaker himself, that &ldquo;practices, at
which our ancestors would have started with indignation, were as
notorious as the sun at noon-day?&rdquo;&nbsp; Why, if as the
Speaker declared, such practices exist, and affect the most
important branch of the Legislature, I myself say, that there is
corruption in the very vitals of the Constitution itself.&nbsp;
In such a state of things, to talk of the Constitution, is
mockery and insult; and I say there is no Constitution.&nbsp;
What, then, has the writer of this pamphlet said more than has
been avowed by the highest authority, and everybody knows?&nbsp;
And now, can you lay your hands on your hearts, and by your
verdict of <!-- page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>Guilty send the defendant to linger
in a jail for having published what the author has, under such
circumstances, written?</p>
<p>Having thus concluded my observations on the passages selected
from this paper for prosecution, I will, for I have a right to
read it all if I please, direct your attention to another part of
it.&nbsp; Let us examine whether other passages will not convince
us, that (though he should be mistaken in some of his opinions)
the whole was written with a single and honest intention.&nbsp; I
myself never read a paper, which, on the whole, appeared to be
written with more candour.&nbsp; There is an openness that does
not even spare the writer himself.&nbsp; Indeed, with regard to
his opinions, peculiar and mistaken as he may be, he seems
himself, sincerely to believe in them.&nbsp; He is now suffering
for those opinions, and suffering with a firmness, which to those
who think him wrong, is stubbornness; and, thus, he affords
another proof of the extreme impolicy of attempting to impose
silence by prosecutions, and extort from the mind the abjuration
of opinions by external and physical force.&nbsp; It never
succeeds; but, on the contrary, works the very opposite effect to
that which is its object.&nbsp; As the author from whom I have
just now cited says, with extreme force and equal beauty,
&ldquo;a kind of maternal feeling is excited in the mind that
makes us love the cause for which we suffer.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is
not for the mere point of expression that it has been said, the
blood of the martyrs is the seed of the church.&nbsp; It is not
theological doctrine alone, that thrives and nourishes under
persecution.&nbsp; The principle of the aphorism applies equally
to all opinions upon all subjects.&nbsp; There is widely spread
through our nature an inclination to suspect that there is a
secret value in that from which others attempt to drive us by
force; <!-- page 107--><a name="page107"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 107</span>and from this, joined to other
powerful motives, the persecution of men for their tenets,
whatever they may be, only draws their attachment closer, and
rivets their affections to them.&nbsp; Every effort to make them
abandon the obnoxious doctrine renders them more steadfast to
it.&nbsp; The loppings, which are designed to destroy, serve but
as prunings, from which it shoots with increased vigour, and
strikes its root still deeper.&nbsp; Has it not always been seen,
that persecution has bred in men that stubborn resolution, which
present death has not been able to shake; and, what is more, an
eagerness to disseminate amongst others those principles for
which they have themselves been prosecuted and pursued.&nbsp; I
therefore, from my very soul, deprecate every species of
persecution on account of religious and political opinions, not
only from its illiberality, but bad policy; and I am full of
hope, that you will by your verdict to day show, that you have an
equal aversion to it.</p>
<p>To recur, gentlemen, to the pamphlet; I submit to you that
there is a general air of sincerity in the language of the writer
throughout the composition, which obliges us to believe, that,
however mistaken you may think him in his opinions, he is honest
in his intentions.&nbsp; He says in another part of the address
&ldquo;Every government must derive its support from the body of
the people; and it follows, as a matter of course, that the
people must have a power to withhold their supplies.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Which is very true: for, where there is a shadow of political
liberty, a revenue can only be raised by taxes to which the
people have consented: it being allowed that where there is
taxation without representation tyranny begins.&nbsp; Now, if the
writer really believes that there are corrupt practices in the
Government, who can blame him, for proposing (by <!-- page
108--><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>abstinence from those articles which are taxed and
yield a revenue so large that it supports a system of
misgovernment) to compel our rulers, by a diminution of their
means of undue influence to a regard to economy and a just
administration?&nbsp; I know, indeed, that this doctrine is
considered offensive; nor am I prepared to say with confidence
that under the wide construction which has been given to the law
against conspiracy, persons who were to combine to force such a
change by abstaining from all exciseable articles might not be
indicted for it as a conspiracy.&nbsp; It may, for aught that I
know, be even indictable to unite and desist from using tea,
tobacco and snuff to coerce the government into reform by a
reduction of the revenue raised from those articles; but you are
not sitting there to try an indictment for a conspiracy; and,
therefore, though this passage may not be pleasing, I read it,
without hesitation, because it leads to others, which I think
demand your consideration and attention.&nbsp; &ldquo;We must
deny ourselves, he proceeds to say, those little luxuries in
which we have long indulged.&nbsp; Why not?&nbsp; Who gains, and
who loses by this denial?&nbsp; We do not rob ourselves, we only
check our passions; and, in doing this, we strengthen both our
bodies and our purses.&nbsp; I would appeal to those, who, for
the last year, have had the courage and the virtue to abstain
from the use of malt and spirituous liquors, foreign tea and
coffee, tobacco, snuff, &amp;c., whether they do not feel
satisfaction from the change of habit; and whether they are not
better in health and pocket, without the use of these
things.&rdquo;&nbsp; This, gentlemen, is a sermon on temperance,
and I wish it were generally followed.&nbsp; I apprehend that
this is not only innocent, but highly meritorious.&nbsp; For my
own part I shall maintain the opinion (though ten thousand
Mandevilles should write, and imagine they have proved <!-- page
109--><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>private vices public benefits) that it is infinitely
more important and beneficial that the mass of the people should
be temperate and healthy, though poor, than that an immense
revenue should be collected from their addiction to sensual
pleasures and vicious luxuries.&nbsp; I say vicious, because all
moral writers concur in calling those sensualities vices, as free
indulgence in them leads to a state of total dissipation of mind
under which scarcely any profligacy seems a crime.&nbsp; The
writer continues: &ldquo;There are a variety of other things
which are heavily excised, the use of which might be prudently
dropped; and which are not essential either to the health or
comfort of mankind.&nbsp; Speaking for myself, I can say, I do
not recommend more than I practise; and that my food for the last
year has consisted chiefly of milk and bread and raw native
fruits.&nbsp; I have been fatter and stronger than in any former
year of my life; and I feel as if I had obtained a new system by
the change.&nbsp; <i>My natural disposition is luxurious</i>, and
under a better system of government, or when this rational
warfare was not called for, I should at all times live up to my
income.&rdquo;&nbsp; And here, gentlemen, I beg you to mark, that
so unreserved, so much in earnest is the writer in his object,
that he does not attempt even to conceal his own faults, and
weakness.&nbsp; I ask, whether you have ever found men, who were
acting and writing with duplicity and sinister intentions,
reproach or expose themselves?&nbsp; But the writer of this paper
practises no reserve; he conceals nothing, though the disclosure
should be against himself, but</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pours out all
himself as plain,<br />
As dowright Shippen, or as old Montaigne.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He concludes this exhortation to temperance with this <!--
page 110--><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>sentence, &ldquo;Shrink not then you male and female
reformers from this virtuous mode of warfare; for to conquer our
injurious habits and our enemy at the same time is a double
conquest, to obtain which both man and woman and child can very
properly assist.&rdquo;&nbsp; I read this conclusion of the
paragraph, gentlemen, and I beg your attention to it, because it
makes it manifest that the change which the writer proposes to
compass is a change by a moral operation through legal and
peaceful means; and that he never dreamed of inculcating, as it
is insinuated, any appeal to violence and arms.</p>
<p>I have now, gentlemen, concluded all the particular
observations which I had to address you upon this paper; and
having shown you that by the least liberal construction, no
criminality of intention can be imputed to the author, how can I
doubt of your acquittal?&nbsp; For it is your duty to construe
the author&rsquo;s words so as to give them an innocent meaning
if they will bear it, and not come to a conclusion of guilt from
them unless you shall be convinced that they will not possibly
admit of any other than a criminal sense.&nbsp; That he had no
criminal design, is apparent enough, even from the indicted
passages; and by reading the context is put beyond the
possibility of a doubt.&nbsp; There are many other passages as
well as that, which I have read, which tend equally to the
inference of the sincerity with which the whole paper was
written, but which I will not consume your time in reading, as
you will have the whole before you when you deliberate on your
verdict, and they must themselves strike your attention.</p>
<p>Now, gentlemen, I cannot tell, how you feel, but I have no
opinion more deeply impressed on my mind than that the
prosecution of such political papers as this before you, as state
libels, is perfectly unnecessary; and, so far <!-- page 111--><a
name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>from doing
good, is, if any mischief can be produced by such writings,
mischievous.&nbsp; Prosecution excites the public regard, and a
curiosity that will not rest till it is gratified, towards that
which, under silent neglect, would hardly gain attention; if
indeed, it did not drop quite dead-born from the press.&nbsp; But
I deny wholly that any political writings, whatever their nature,
have done or ever could do any harm to political society.&nbsp;
Let those who advocate the contrary opinion show you a single
instance of a state injured or destroyed by inflammatory
political writings.&nbsp; The republic of Athens was not thrown
down by libels: no&mdash;she perished for want of that widely
diffused excitement to courage, and patriotism, and virtue, which
a press perfectly free and unshackled can alone spread throughout
a whole people.&nbsp; She was not ruined by anarchy into which
she was thrown by seditious writings, but because, sunk in luxury
and enervated by refinement, it was impossible to rouse the
Athenians to the energy and ardour of facing and withstanding the
enemy in the field.&nbsp; Rome too&mdash;as little was her
gigantic power levelled with the dust by libels, but perished
from the corruptions of the tyrannical government of the
Emperors, which drained the nation of all its ancient virtue, and
bred the slavery which produces an utter debasement of the mind
(and which never could have been, if a free publication of
political opinion had been suffered), and thus she fell an easy
conquest and prey to the barbarians and Goths.&nbsp; Both these
renowned states fell, because their governments and the people
wanted the goad of a free press to excite them to that public
spirit and virtue, without which no country is capable of
political independence and liberty.&nbsp; How our ears have been
dinned with the French revolution, and how often have we been
gravely told, that it was caused by the writings of Voltaire,
Rousseau, and <!-- page 112--><a name="page112"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 112</span>Helvetius.&nbsp; Ridiculous!&nbsp; I
have read the history of those times and have read it very
differently.&nbsp; I am forced to understand that the
inextricable and utter embarrassment of the French finances, the
selfish and insolent luxury of the nobles, the desperate
wretchedness of the lower orders of the people, and the
profligate licentiousness of the Court, were the causes and the
only causes of that great event.&nbsp; If the finances of that
country had been in order, the nobles moderate, the poor
unoppressed, and any public spirit in the Government, Voltaire,
and Helvetius, and Rousseau, might have racked their brains for
thought, and written themselves blind, before they would have
raised a single arm, or even excited a single voice to exclaim
for change.&nbsp; A perfect freedom of the press would, indeed,
have prevented the causes which roused the people to assert
themselves; but the causes once in existence, all the writers in
the world could not one moment have either retarded the
revolution or accelerated it.&nbsp; It is not the representations
of a political writer that can alter the nature of things.&nbsp;
Whose ingenuity, and wit, and eloquence, will persuade me that I
am cold when I am warm; that I am hungry when I am full; a slave
when I am free; and miserable, when I feel myself happy?&nbsp;
While such is my state, what writings would drive me into
insurrection?&nbsp; And if the contrary is my condition, what
stimulus could I want to free myself from it?&nbsp; What
persuasions could possibly even delay my utmost efforts for a
change?&nbsp; It is not by the prosecution of political libels
that the stability of a government and domestic peace is ever
secured.&nbsp; No; let the Government pursue its only end, the
public good, and let every man, or at least a large majority,
have more or less an interest in the preservation of the State,
and then all the writers in the country, from the highest down
<!-- page 113--><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>to the obscurest corners of Grub-Street, may wear their
fingers to the roots of the nails with their pens, before they
will work the slightest discontent in the public or change in the
government.&nbsp; Nothing, gentlemen, is more common with writers
and speakers, than to discourse of states by figures drawn from
the government of a ship; and I will tell you what I once heard
from a friend of mine who has served his country in our navy, and
which at the time most forcibly struck my mind.&nbsp; &ldquo;When
I was stationed in the Mediterranean (he said, speaking of the
occurrences of his professional experience) we made captures of
the vessels of all countries except the Greeks, but we never
captured them; for they were always vigilant, active, and
brave.&nbsp; We never surprised them; if we chased them, they
escaped us; and if we attempted to cut them from the shelter to
which we had driven them, we were repulsed.&rdquo;&nbsp; What
created this difference?&nbsp; By the rules of navigation amongst
the Greek islands, every man, from the captain down to the lowest
cabin-boy, has, more or less, a share in the vessel.&nbsp; They
watched, therefore,&mdash;they laboured and fought for their own
interest and property.&nbsp; Let those who sit at the helm and
govern us imitate this policy.&nbsp; Let them extend the elective
franchise; let them restore us to a condition in which industry
and skill may find employment and be secure in their gain.&nbsp;
Give men an interest and ownership in the state, and it shall
never be upset by libels; not a seditious or mutinous voice shall
be heard; and what foreign enemy shall dare to lift a hand
against us?&nbsp; But keep the people excluded from their share
in the representation, and pressed down by taxation, and millions
of prosecutions against libels will not save the country from
sinking in ruin.</p>
<p>Let me now, gentlemen, call your attention back to the <!--
page 114--><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>argument I used almost at setting out in my address to
you, by which I attempted to maintain that you are not bound,
whatever you may judge the intention of the writer to have been,
to pronounce a publication a libel by your verdict, if you should
be of opinion that such a publication cannot be mischievous, and
that prosecution of it is unnecessary.&nbsp; If it can do no
harm, it is no nuisance at common law to have written a paper,
whatever its nature may be, and if it could be no nuisance, you
are bound in duty to acquit the defendant, who is only the
publisher.&nbsp; The doctrine for which I am contending with
regard to this paper, has been acted upon by the government of
one free country, with regard to all political writings, whatever
their intention or nature.&nbsp; The Legislature of the State of
Virginia has actually <i>legislated against</i> such
prosecutions, and declared them totally unnecessary.</p>
<p>Mr. Justice <span class="smcap">Best</span>.&mdash;That is not
the law of this country.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>.&mdash;I only use it my
Lord as part of my speech in argument.</p>
<p>Mr. Justice <span class="smcap">Best</span>.&mdash;I will tell
you what I am bound to tell the jury.&nbsp; I shall tell them
that we have nothing to do here with what may be expedient, we
are not legislating here&mdash;the question is whether this is a
proper prosecution?</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>.&mdash;I feel that it is
exceedingly important to use as matter of argument, and as a part
of my speech.&nbsp; If your Lordship stops me I know that it will
be my duty to submit.</p>
<p>Mr. Justice <span class="smcap">Best</span>.&mdash;All this is
only drawing them away from the question they are to
consider.&nbsp; With the propriety of instituting the prosecution
they have nothing to do; the only questions they have to
determine, are&mdash;Is that paper a libel, and has the defendant
published it?&nbsp; An Act of the Assembly of Virginia has no
validity in this country.</p>
<p><!-- page 115--><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>.&mdash;My Lord, I
do not cite it as a statute of this realm to which we are bound
to pay legal attention&mdash;</p>
<p>Mr. Justice <span class="smcap">Best</span>.&mdash;We are
bound to pay no attention to it.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>.&mdash;My Lord, I only
use it to show that other men have been of the opinion which I
have expressed to your Lordship and the jury.&nbsp; If your
Lordship insists on my not addressing myself to the jury upon it,
I know too well the deference that is due from me to the Bench to
persevere in attempting it.</p>
<p>Mr. Justice <span class="smcap">Best</span>.&mdash;No, I
don&rsquo;t insist upon it.&nbsp; But, Mr. Cooper, can you
deceive yourself so much as to think this has anything to do with
the question?&nbsp; I shall tell the jury to pay no attention to
it.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>.&mdash;Your Lordship
will make any observations your condescension may lead you to
make, as well on this as on any other part of the defence.&nbsp;
I believe the course which I wish to take was taken on a similar
occasion by a man who united the soundest and correctest judgment
with the brightest imagination&mdash;I mean Lord
Erskine&mdash;he&mdash;</p>
<p>Mr. Justice <span class="smcap">Best</span>.&mdash;I knew him
for thirty odd years at the bar, and I never in all my life knew
him address himself to points such as these&mdash;that is all I
can say.&nbsp; I know what is due to the liberty of the bar, and
I shall cherish a love for its freedom to the latest hour of my
life.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>.&mdash;If your lordship
refuses me&mdash;</p>
<p>Mr. Justice <span class="smcap">Best</span>.&mdash;No, I
don&rsquo;t refuse you.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>.&mdash;I think it
necessary to my case.&nbsp; The preamble is&mdash;(gentlemen, I
am sorry to detain you, but I have a most important duty to
discharge.&nbsp; If in addressing you, I am taking a course which
I ought not, I assure you it is an error of judgment and not of
design.&nbsp; I declare most sincerely, that I am addressing to
you arguments <!-- page 116--><a name="page116"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 116</span>which I should attend to if they
were addressed to myself in such a case.&nbsp; His Lordship will
have a right to make what observations he pleases, and of course
I offer this and every other argument to you liable to the honour
he may confer upon me of condescending to notice anything I have
said or may say.&nbsp; You, gentlemen, will, I know, regard my
observations or arguments solely as you think them forcible or
weak; if they are the former you will attend to them, if the
latter reject them.&nbsp; And with this observation I shall now
proceed to read to you the preamble to the Act of the Legislative
Assembly of Virginia.)</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It is time enough for the rightful purposes
of Civil Government, for its officers to interfere when
principles break out into overt acts against peace and good
order, and that truth is great and will prevail if left to
herself, and that she is the proper and sufficient antagonist to
error, and has nothing to fear from the conflict, unless, by
human interposition disarmed of her natural weapons, free
argument and debate: errors ceasing to be dangerous, when it is
permitted freely to contradict them.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, you see, by an Act of the Legislature of that country,
passed by those who had all the knowledge of history before their
eyes, and ample experience in their own times, I am fully
supported in the position that prosecutions of this kind are not
only useless but hurtful.&nbsp; By free argument and debate
errors cease to be dangerous, if they are not exploded; but
attempts to stifle even errors by power and punishment, provoke a
stubborn adherence to them, and awake an eager spirit of
propagation.&nbsp; If erroneous positions are published, meet
them by argument, and refutation must ensue.&nbsp; If falsehood
uses the press to promulge her doctrines, let truth oppose her
with the same weapon.&nbsp; Let the press answer the <!-- page
117--><a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
117</span>press, and what is there to fear?&nbsp; Shall I be told
that the propensity of human nature is so base and evil that it
will listen to falsehood and turn a deaf ear to truth?&nbsp; To
assert so is not only scandalous to human nature, but impious
towards the Creator.&nbsp; We are placed here imperfect indeed,
and erring; but still with preponderance of virtue over
vice.&nbsp; The Deity has sent us from his hands with qualities
fitting us for civil society: it is our natural state; and we
know that civil society is sapped by vice and supported by
virtue: if, therefore, our disposition to good did not redound
over the evil a state of society could not be maintained.&nbsp;
It would indeed be an impiety little short of blasphemy to the
great Being who has created us, to say, that mankind at large are
eagerly inclined to what is vicious, but turn with aversion from
what is moral and good.&nbsp; Yet this, whatever they may avow,
must be the opinion of those who say that good doctrine from the
press cannot be left with safety to oppose bad.</p>
<p>Now, gentlemen, not only am I not without the corroboration of
this enactment of the Legislature of Virginia for my humble
opinions, but the Act of Virginia is itself not without the very
highest human sanction, as I shall show you by a passage which I
am about to cite from the work of a man, with whom, in my mind,
the writings of all other men are but as the ill-timed uninformed
prattlings of children&mdash;a man from whom to differ in opinion
is but another phrase to be wrong.&nbsp; Need I, after this, name
him? for was there ever more than one man who could be identified
with such a description?&nbsp; I mean Locke, the great champion
of civil freedom.&nbsp; In this work on government he
says&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Perhaps it will be said, that the people
being ignorant <!-- page 118--><a name="page118"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 118</span>and always discontented, to lay the
foundations of government in the unsteady opinion and uncertain
humour of the people, is to expose it to certain ruin, and no
government will be able long to subsist if the people may set up
a new legislature whenever they take offence at the old.&nbsp; To
this I answer, quite the contrary, people are not so easy got out
of their old forms as some are apt to suggest; they are hardly to
be prevailed with to amend the acknowledged faults in the frame
they have been accustomed to, and if there be any original
defects or adventitious ones introduced by time or corruption, it
is not an easy thing to be changed, even where all the world sees
there is an opportunity for it.&nbsp; This slowness and aversion
in the people to quit their old constitutions has in the many
revolutions which have been seen in this kingdom still kept us
to, or, after some intervals of fruitless attempts, still brought
us back again to our old legislature of King, Lords and
Commons.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such is the opinion of this greatest of men, formed on the
most consummate wisdom, enriched by observation, during times
which afforded no small degree of experience.&nbsp; Upon his
authority, then, that men are not to be excited to sudden
discontent, and passion for hasty change, I assert, that there is
no danger to be apprehended from the freest political
discussions; and consequently no need of their condemnation by a
jury&rsquo;s verdict of Guilty.</p>
<p>Milton, too, the greatest of poets, and hardly less a
politician, was of the same sentiment as to the firmness of the
people, and thought it might safely be left to them to read what
they pleased, and to their reason and discretion, what to object
and what to adopt, without any other interference.&nbsp; It is
his Areopagitica, in which he contends for unlicensed
printing&mdash;an oration addressed <!-- page 119--><a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>from his
closet to the Parliament of England, and which has been cited by
Lord Mansfield himself, on the bench.&nbsp; His words
are&mdash;&ldquo;Nor is it to the common people less than a
reproach; for if we be so jealous of them that we cannot trust
them with an English pamphlet, what do we but censure them for a
giddy, vicious and ungrounded people?&nbsp; That this is care or
love of them we cannot pretend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such are the sentiments of Milton, in that noble effort of
united argument and eloquence, which I should not fear to hold up
against the most splendid orations of antiquity.</p>
<p>Having thus, I submit, made good my position, that political
papers, whatever their description, can produce no mischief, and
that there is no need to prosecute them; I will now show you,
that not only can publications, containing false opinions, do no
mischief, but that they actually produce benefit, and that
therefore not they, but the prosecutions, which would check, and
stifle them are injurious.&nbsp; Is it meant to be contended that
error is stronger than truth; folly more powerful than reason,
and irreligion than religion?&nbsp; No man, in his senses, will
maintain such propositions.&nbsp; On the contrary, error has
always been dispersed before reason, and infidelity by
religion.&nbsp; The appearance of error and falsehood has always
roused Truth to rise to the work of refutation.&nbsp; Even the
sublime truths of religion have never been so completely
demonstrated, and conviction and faith have never been so firmly
fixed in the minds of men as by those books of controversy which
have been drawn forth by attacks upon Christianity; and which,
but for the publications denying the authenticity of the
religion, would never have been in existence; but, invaluable as
they are, the world must have wanted them.&nbsp; As to political
<!-- page 120--><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>writings, is it not notorious, that the very best
expositions of the nature of civil society and government, are
solely to be ascribed to the conflicts of reason with the false
and loathsome doctrines of passive obedience and divine
indefeasible right, which found their way into the world by the
freedom of publication?&nbsp; Even that great work, the treatise
of Locke on Government, itself, which is justly regarded as the
political Bible (I mean no irreverence) of Englishmen, would
never have seen the light, but that it was written to refute the
base and detestable tenets of Barclay and Filmer.&nbsp; Their
political treatises were false and slavish, and even illegal; for
they were the same for which Dr. Sacheverel was afterwards
impeached by the Parliament; and which he would not have been if
it had not been an offence to maintain and publish such
opinions.&nbsp; Yet were not their falsehoods and errors useful
and beneficial?&nbsp; Did they not provoke Locke to rise in all
the majesty and strength of truth and cast down Filmer and his
doctrines into the lowest abyss of contempt, never again to
emerge?&nbsp; See, now, if the government of those days had
prosecuted Barclay and Filmer, and suppressed their books by
power instead of leaving them to be demolished by reasoning, what
would have been the consequence?&nbsp; The mighty mind of Locke
would not have been called into action, and the total refutation
and utter explosion of Filmer would not have been effected.&nbsp;
By criminal prosecutions the odious positions would only have
been suppressed for a time, not as they now are, extinguished for
ever; and the base and degrading doctrines of passive obedience
and divine right, which are the stigma of the times in which they
prevailed, might have been the disgrace and reproach of ours.</p>
<p>But supposing that prosecutions for political writings <!--
page 121--><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>were in any respect politic, useful, or wise, will they
prevent their publication?&nbsp; No more than your strong and
violent revenue laws have been able to suppress the rise of
illicit stills in Ireland and Scotland.&nbsp; Even if by dint of
the terror of prosecutions the press in this city could be
reduced to such awe and subjection, that everything that issued
from it was as flat and unmeaning as the most arbitrary
government could desire, its inhabitants would still gratify
their thirst for political discussion and information.&nbsp; They
would compose and print as they distil, in the depth of deserts
and the solitude of mountains, and under the cover of darkness
drop the pamphlets into the houses, or scatter them in the
streets, and the obstacles to circulation will serve only to
inflame the desire for possession.&nbsp; This would be the result
of a determination to suppress everything in the shape of
political discussion that did not please the humour of a set of
men in authority, while by far the greater part if not all those
publications which inspire so much apprehension, would if passed
in silence either never be noticed, or read their hour and
forgotten.&nbsp; It is these public trials that give them
importance and notoriety.&nbsp; They would not draw an eye but
for the glare thrown on them by these luminous
prosecutions.&nbsp; These indictments (though I would not
willingly be ludicrous on so serious an occasion) force into my
mind the course once adopted with regard to houses of ill-fame,
by the Society for the Suppression of Vice.&nbsp; They paid men
who were fixed before the doors of such houses with huge paper
lanterns, on which there was painted in large illuminated
letters, &ldquo;This is a house of bad fame.&rdquo;&nbsp; But,
instead of causing a desertion of the houses, they operated as an
advertisement and an allurement, and increased the numbers who
resorted <!-- page 122--><a name="page122"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 122</span>to them.&nbsp; Those who had before
frequented them did not discontinue their visits, and those who
were ignorant of such places and seeking them, on seeing the
emblazonment by the doors, cried out&mdash;that is just what we
wanted, and turned in.&nbsp; The society at last discovered their
mistake.&nbsp; They found that they were encouraging what they
wished to abolish, and discontinued the plan.&nbsp; My learned
friend, who is counsel for the society, can confirm me when I
assert that they do not now carry it into practice.&nbsp;
Precisely the operation that these lanterns had with regard to
houses of ill-fame, have these trials upon obnoxious
writings.&nbsp; They are illuminated by the rays which are shed
on them by these proceedings.&nbsp; They attract every eye, and
are read in the light (as it were) of the notoriety which is thus
thrown upon them by these prosecutions.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, it just occurs to my recollection, that I have
omitted in its proper place something which I ought to have
mentioned, and urged to you, and I beg your indulgence to supply
the omission.&nbsp; You will remember that in one of the passages
charged as libelous, the words &ldquo;I will not, now, say a word
about insurrection&rdquo; are to be found, and my learned friend,
Mr. Gurney, suggested to you that it was an excitement, at some
future period, to insurrection.&nbsp; I, gentlemen, repeat that
these words are not only no excitement to insurrection, but an
express disavowal of it.&nbsp; If you infer that he means
insurrection at any future time, you must also suppose that the
insurrection he contemplates is conditional, and in speculation
of conduct in the government that may justify it.&nbsp; Is there
any extrinsic evidence to show that he means something beyond the
words?&nbsp; None&mdash;and the words themselves are a literal
disclaimer of any intention of insurrection.&nbsp; And it is by
the words then that you will judge of his design, <!-- page
123--><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
123</span>and not take it from the vague and partial declamation
of the counsel for the prosecution, whose opinions ought no more
than my own, to have any weight with you, except as they are
supported by reason.&nbsp; If you can find any such meaning as an
intention to excite insurrection in the words, so much the worse
for the defendant; but, if you cannot, and I am sure you cannot,
then you will not hesitate to adjudge the words innocent.&nbsp;
What! may not I, or any man, say there is no occasion for
insurrection at this moment, but there may be at a future
time?&nbsp; Good God! are there no possible situations in which
resistance to a government will be justifiable?&nbsp; There have
been such situations, and may again.&nbsp; Surely there may
be.&nbsp; Why, even the most vehement strugglers for indefeasible
right and passive obedience have been forced (after involving
themselves in the most foolish inconsistencies, and after the
most ludicrous shuffling in attempting to deny it) to admit, that
there may be such a conjuncture.&nbsp; They have tried to qualify
the admission indeed&mdash;admitted, and then
retracted&mdash;then admitted again, and then denied in the term,
what they admitted in the phrase, till, as you shall see, nothing
ever equalled the absurdity, and ridiculousness of the
<i>rigmarole</i> into which they fell, in their unwillingness to
confess, what they were unable to deny.&nbsp; Yes, gentlemen,
there are situations in which insurrection against a government
is not only legal, but a duty and a virtue.&nbsp; The period of
our glorious revolution was such a situation.&nbsp; When the
bigot, James, attempted to force an odious superstition on the
people for their religion, and to violate the fundamental laws of
the realm, Englishmen owed it to themselves, they owed it to
millions of their fellow-creatures, not only in this country, but
all over the world; they owed it to God who had made them man to
rise <!-- page 124--><a name="page124"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 124</span>against such a government; and cast
ruin on the tyrant for the oppression and slavery which he
meditated for them.&nbsp; Locke, in the work from which I have
already cited to you, in the chapter entitled, &ldquo;On
Dissolution of Government,&rdquo; contends with Barclay, an
advocate for divine right and passive obedience, and refutes him
on this very question, and proves that subjects may use force
against tyranny in governments.&nbsp; He cites Barclay who wrote
in Latin, but I read to you from the translation.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Wherefore if the king shall be guilty of
immense and intolerable cruelty not only against individuals but
against the body of the state, that it is the whole people, or
any large part of the people, in such a case indeed it is
competent to the people to resist and defend themselves from
injury, but only to defend themselves, not to attack the prince,
and only to repair the injury they have received; not to depart,
on account of the injury received from the reverence which they
owe him.&nbsp; When the tyranny is intolerable (for we ought
always to submit to a tyranny in a moderate degree) the subject
may resist with reverence.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In commenting on this passage, Mr. Locke, mixes with his
reasonings the ridicule it deserves:&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;He (that
is Barclay) says, it must be with reverence.&rsquo;&nbsp; How to
resist force without striking again, or how to strike with
reverence, will need some skill to make intelligible.&nbsp; He
that shall oppose an assault only with a shield to receive the
blow, or in any more respectful posture without a sword in his
hand, to abate the confidence and force of the assailant will
quickly be at the end of his resistance, and will find such a
defence serve only to draw on him the worse usage: this is as
ridiculous a way of resisting, as Juvenal thought of fighting,
&lsquo;Ubi tu <i>pulsas</i>, ego <i>vapulo</i> <!-- page 125--><a
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>tantum,&rsquo; and the result of the combat will be
unavoidably the same as he there describes it.</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Libertas
paupcris h&aelig;c est.<br />
<i>Pulsatus</i> rogat, et <i>pugnis</i> concisus adorat,<br />
Ut <i>liceat</i> paucis cum dentibus inde <i>reverti</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;This is the liberty of the slave: when beaten
and bruised with blows, he requests and implores as a favour to
be allowed to depart with some few of his teeth.&rsquo;&nbsp;
This will always be the event of such an imaginary resistance,
when men may not strike again.&nbsp; He, therefore, who may
resist must be allowed to strike.&nbsp; And then let our author,
or anybody else, join a knock on the head, or a cut on the face,
with as much reverence and respect as he thinks fit.&nbsp; He
that can reconcile blows and reverence may, for aught I know,
deserve for his pains, a civil respectful cudgeling whenever he
can meet with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So much, gentlemen, for the doctrine of non-resistance.&nbsp;
Therefore the author of this paper in stating that there may be
times when insurrection may be called for, has done no more than
a hundred other writers, and among them Locke, have done before
him.</p>
<p>Locke proceeding still with the discussion of the question,
whether oppressive governments may be opposed by the people, and,
having concluded in the affirmative, says, &ldquo;But here the
question may be made, who shall be judge whether the prince or
legislature act contrary to their trust.&nbsp; This, perhaps, ill
affected and factious men may spread among the people, when the
prince only makes use of his just prerogative.&nbsp; To this, I
reply, the people shall be judge; for who shall be judge whether
the trustee or deputy acts with and according to the trust that
is reposed in him, but he who deputes him, and must, by having
deputed him, have still a power to discard him <!-- page 126--><a
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>when he
fails in his trust.&nbsp; If this be reasonable in particular
cases of private men, why should it be otherwise in that of the
greatest moment when the welfare of millions is concerned, and
also when the evil if not prevented is greater, and the redress
very dear, difficult, and dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Locke, therefore, most unambiguously concludes that
insurrection may be justified and necessary.&nbsp; A greater and
more important truth does not exist, and we owe its promulgation
with such freedom and boldness to that most extraordinary and
felicitous conjuncture at the revolution which called upon us to
support a king against a king, and obliged us to explode (as has
been done most completely) the divine right and passive obedience
under which one king claimed, to maintain the legal title of the
other.</p>
<p>Locke goes on further to say&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This question, who shall be supreme judge? cannot mean
that there is no judge at all.&nbsp; For where there is no
judicature on earth to decide controversies among men, God in
heaven is judge.&nbsp; But every man is to judge for himself, as
in all other cases, so in this, whether another hath put himself
in a state of war with him, and whether, as Jeptha did, he should
appeal to the Supreme Judge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I beg that I may not be misinterpreted, I hope it will not be
said I mean to insinuate that any circumstances at present exist
to justify insurrection.&nbsp; I protest against any such
inference.&nbsp; Nothing can be further from my thoughts, and I
regret that such an extravagant mode of construing men&rsquo;s
words should be in fashion, as to render such a caution on my
part needful.&nbsp; All I say is, that the writer of this paper
spoke of insurrection conditionally, and prospectively only, and,
in doing so, has done no more than Locke, in other terms had done
before him.</p>
<p><!-- page 127--><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>Gentlemen, I have but a very few more arguments to
address to you, and I am glad of it, for I assure you, you cannot
be more exhausted in patience than I am in strength.</p>
<p>I now, gentlemen, ask you even admitting that the <i>style</i>
and manner, in which the opinions of the writer of this address
are expressed, should verge upon intemperance and impropriety,
would you venture, merely upon the ground of such a defect in
style, to say the defendant is guilty; when the very same
opinions in substance, expressed in a different style, would be
innocent and legal, and unquestionable?&nbsp; Gentlemen, I have
heard it asserted, with a surprise that I cannot express, that if
persons will write in a moderate, delicate, temperate, and
refined style they may discuss questions which become
exceptionable and forbidden if they are handled in a coarse and
illiberal style.&nbsp; Now I should have thought, that the very
reverse of this would have been the case; for by a refined and
guarded style you may insinuate and persuade&mdash;by vulgar
coarseness and intemperance you disgust and nauseate.&nbsp; To
say that a political paper of the very same sentiments, and
principles would be innocent, written in a calm and delicate
style which would be criminal, written in an abrupt, vehement and
passionate manner, is to remove guilt from the thought and
conception and substance of a writing, and impute it to the
medium only of the thought, the mere expression.&nbsp; So that
upon such a rule and principle of decision, if I were to heap
violent and gross abuse even on Abershaw, or any other
highwayman, who was deservedly hanged a hundred years ago, I
might actually be indicted for a libel.&nbsp; Such a course,
gentlemen, would be to degrade your judgments from a decision
upon the thought, and <!-- page 128--><a name="page128"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 128</span>opinions (which, are alone
important) of an author to a criticism and condemnation of his
words, and would be waging war with the vocabulary and the
dictionary, a degradation, to which I trust, your reason will
never submit.&nbsp; A difference of style in political writings
is much too refined and subtle to found a distinction upon
between innocence and crime.&nbsp; Difference of style is so
minute, and is a subject of such nice discrimination, that it
would not only be difficult, but almost impossible, and most
unsafe for any jury to attempt by it to draw a line between guilt
and innocence; besides, what would be the effect upon the
press?&nbsp; If I were told, when I sat down to write upon any
topic, that I must treat it in a given style, and no other, or
risk prosecution, I should be confounded, and throw down my pen
without writing at all.&nbsp; At least I should either not write
at all, or write in such a manner that I might as well not have
written at all, for I should most certainly never be read.&nbsp;
Good God! to leave a man the alternative of a particular style,
or an indictment for a libel, when he sat down to compose, would
be like placing a torpedo on his hand; for you cannot, as was
most forcibly, and beautifully said by Lord Erskine,
&ldquo;expect men to communicate their free thoughts to one
another under the terror of a lash hanging over their
heads;&rdquo; and again, on another occasion, &ldquo;under such
circumstances, no man could sit down to write a pamphlet, without
an attorney at one elbow, and a counsel at the
other.&rdquo;&nbsp; Gentlemen, if you, sitting coolly and
dispassionately to give a deliberate judgment upon the manner and
style of an author&rsquo;s composition would find it difficult to
form a certain judgment, how great, how insuperable, must be the
difficulty of the writer himself.&nbsp; How is he when he sits
down intent on his subject and when vehement and <!-- page
129--><a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
129</span>ardent (as he must be, if he is in earnest, and that he
may persuade others of that, which he feels himself) and his
ideas are thronging and pressing upon him for
expression&mdash;how is he to be select and cautious and measured
in his words?&nbsp; Would you not by subjecting the freedom of
political discussion to such a restriction run the hazard of
destroying it altogether?&nbsp; Upon this question of the
difficulty of distinguishing between propriety and impropriety in
the style of writings I can not abstain from reading to you a
passage from a speech of Lord Chesterfield, which was quoted by
Lord Erskine, when he was at the bar, upon a trial for
libel.&nbsp; On that occasion, indeed, Lord Kenyon told him, that
he believed it flowed from the pen of Dr. Johnson, and
<i>that</i> Lord Erskine took as a valuable concession; for from
the frame of mind and bias of that learned man on political
subjects, he was certainly not a friend to popular liberty, while
Lord Chesterfield, I believe, acted without deviation upon Whig
principles, and was a constant advocate for the freedom of the
press.&nbsp; From Dr. Johnson, however, it was most important, as
it had the effect of an unwilling admission, and if Lord Kenyon
was correct in attributing the speech to Dr. Johnson, its
excellence is to be inferred from the fact, that Lord
Chesterfield never discountenanced the opinion that he was its
author.&nbsp; The passage is this:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;One of the greatest blessings we enjoy, one
of the greatest blessings a people, my Lords, can enjoy, is
liberty; but every good in this life has its alloy of evil;
licentiousness is the alloy of liberty; it is an ebullition, an
excrescence&mdash;it is a speck upon the eye of the political
body: but which I can never touch but with a gentle, with a
trembling hand, lest I destroy the body, lest I injure the eye
upon which it is apt to appear.</p>
<p><!-- page 130--><a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>&ldquo;There is such a connection between
licentiousness and liberty, that it is not easy to correct the
one, without dangerously wounding the other: it is extremely hard
to distinguish the true limit between them: like a changeable
silk, we can easily see there are two different colours, but we
cannot easily discover where the one ends, or where the other
begins.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gurney</span>.&mdash;You should state,
in fairness and candour, that that was an argument against
licensing.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>.&mdash;I know it
was.&nbsp; The argument contends for the difficulty, next to
impossibility, of distinguishing where that which is allowable
ends, and that which is licentious begins.&nbsp; A licenser could
not tell where to allow, and where to object, yet a licenser,
gentlemen, would have had just the same means of judging that you
possess; and if he could not tell with distinctness and certainty
what to let pass and what to stop, how, with no greater power,
and means of judgment, can you?&nbsp; With what justice, then,
can it be objected to me, that I have shown any want of candour
in not stating the precise question on which the argument was
delivered, when in the principle there is not a shadow of
difference?&nbsp; My application of the passage is therefore
perfectly just.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I have only one more quotation to trouble you with
before I conclude.&nbsp; That is the opinion of Lord
Loughborough, afterwards Chancellor of England.&nbsp; I do not
know in what case, or on what occasion it was delivered, but I
believe in a judgment on a case of libel.&nbsp; &ldquo;Every man
(says that judge) may publish at his discretion, his opinions
concerning forms and systems of government.&nbsp; <i>If they be
weak and absurd</i>, <i>they will be laughed at and
forgotten</i>; <i>and</i>, <i>if they be</i> bon&acirc; fide,
<i>they cannot be criminal</i>, <i>however
erroneous</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 131--><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>This is the opinion of a great judge upon political
publications, sitting under the authority of the king himself to
administer the laws; and to apply this authority to the paper
before you, what reason on earth have you to suppose, that the
writer from the beginning to the end was not bon&acirc; fide in
his opinions; and then, however erroneous they may be, I say,
under the sanction of Lord Loughborough himself, they are not
criminal.</p>
<p>Having, gentlemen, submitted these observations to you, I
declare most unfeignedly that I have uttered them with the most
conscientious belief, that they are founded in reason, justice,
and truth.&nbsp; I have not advanced a proposition nor uttered a
sentiment as an advocate, which I am not prepared to avow and
maintain as a man.&nbsp; If I am wrong in my judgment, you will
correct me.&nbsp; You will, however, consider my reasonings, and
the passages which I have cited to you in support of them, and
judge if I have not maintained the propositions, which I have
submitted to you.</p>
<p>No argument can be drawn from any of the observations, which I
have addressed to you for impunity to libelers and defamers of
private character.&nbsp; No, they are justly called assassins;
for they who destroy that without which life is worthless are as
guilty as those who destroy life itself, and let them feel the
heaviest vengeance of the law.&nbsp; Private persons may be
attacked and have no power to defend themselves.&nbsp; They may
not only be unable themselves to answer published calumnies
against their character; but also unable to employ those who
can.&nbsp; But such can never be the case with those who
administer the affairs of the nation.&nbsp; All the wealth and
power of the country is in their hands.&nbsp; They may hire a
thousand writers to support their measures, and vindicate their
characters, and they <!-- page 132--><a name="page132"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 132</span>will not want volunteers; they can
command the press; and, for their protection, it is sufficient,
that the press should be opposed to the press.&nbsp; Private
individuals cannot command the press; and, therefore, let
slanderers of private character suffer the utmost punishment that
the law can inflict.</p>
<p>And now, gentlemen, I ask you to give me your verdict for the
defendant.&nbsp; I make no attempt to move your compassion.&nbsp;
I will not urge you to consider that the defendant is a woman,
and unable, from the tenderness of her sex, to sustain hardship;
nor call upon you to remember, that which you cannot but know,
that she has already been convicted upon one prosecution, for
which she will, without doubt, be the subject of severe
punishment.&nbsp; I ask it on the higher ground of justice;
though, I confess, that I hope and wish it with more anxiety,
because I trust it will send these embodied prosecutors, this
Constitutional Association, as (by the figure, I suppose, of
<i>lucus a non lucendo</i>) they entitle themselves, into that
obscurity to which they properly belong, or at least if they will
obtrude further upon the impatience of the public, let them carry
with them the ill omen of a failure in their first attempt to
insinuate, either that the English Constitution is deficient in
its establishment of responsible law officers of the crown, or
that those officers are incapable of fulfilling the duties of
their station.&nbsp; It is said, and I hope truly, that the
country is gradually recovering from the distress, under which it
has so long suffered, and that plenty and prosperity have again
begun to flow in upon us.&nbsp; May it be so! but we shall never
derive enjoyment from any improvement in our physical condition;
unless it is accompanied with domestic tranquillity.&nbsp; To be
happy we must be at peace amongst ourselves; and nothing will
<!-- page 133--><a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span>have the effect of allaying the heart-burnings of
political animosity and uniting us, as it were, in bands of
harmonious brotherhood, so much as a discouragement of these
party prosecutions, which, while they kindle feelings of
indignation, and hostility, and hatred in large numbers of the
people, are of no general benefit to the state.&nbsp; Fling back
this prosecution, then, in the faces of those who have instituted
it; and, instead of sending this unfortunate woman to a prison,
send her back by your verdict of acquittal to the children of her
brother, who, deprived (in the manner you know) both of their
father and mother, are as much orphans as they would be by their
death; and who, sordid and neglected in her absence, are
requiring her care.&nbsp; And, what is more, you will, by your
verdict of Not Guilty, give security to the free expression of
public opinion, compose our dissensions, and protect both
yourselves and posterity; since in calling on you to acquit the
defendant, I call on you to protect the freedom of the press, and
with it the freedom of the country; for unless the press is
preserved, and preserved inviolate, the political liberties of
Englishmen are lost.</p>
<p>Mr. Justice <span class="smcap">Best</span>.&mdash;It was his
duty to call back the attention of the jury to the question which
they were to try.&nbsp; A number of observations had been made
relative to what had taken place in Virginia, but which had
nothing to do with the verdict which they were to give.&nbsp; One
observation had been made, in the propriety of which he perfectly
agreed, which was that they would dismiss from their minds all
prejudices.&nbsp; The learned counsel for the defendant seemed to
think that the name of Carlile was sufficient to create
prejudices.&nbsp; If that were the case, he hoped the jury would
forget that the present defendant was of that name.&nbsp; They
had nothing now to do but to exercise <!-- page 134--><a
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>their
judgment upon the facts before them.&nbsp; The jury were told,
and truly told, that they were the judges as to whether this was
a libel or not.&nbsp; The statute gave the jury the power of
finding a general verdict; but they still were bound under the
sanction of their oaths to find it according to law.&nbsp; He
should give his opinion, and the jury were at liberty to differ
with him; but he must beg in the most distinct terms to state
that the jury or the court had nothing to do with the propriety
or impropriety of these prosecutions, or with the association by
which the prosecution had been instituted.&nbsp; For his own part
he did not know by whom it had been instituted until he had been
requested by the defendant to ask the jurors as they went into
the box, whether or not they were members of that
association.&nbsp; The two questions to be decided were, first,
Was this pamphlet a libel? and secondly, Was the defendant the
publisher?&nbsp; They must lay out of their consideration acts of
parliament passed in Virginia.&nbsp; The principles laid down in
the preamble of the act alluded to, might be a good principle for
America, but he was bound to tell them that it was not law in
England.&nbsp; In the book quoted from by the learned gentlemen,
it was said &ldquo;how wretched must be the state of society in a
country where the laws were uncertain;&rdquo; and that must be
the case where the jury take into consideration the propriety or
impropriety of laws.&nbsp; In his opinion this publication was
libelous, and if the jury were not satisfied of the contrary, the
safer course would be for the jury to agree in opinion with one
who must be presumed to be acquainted with the law, and who gives
that opinion upon his oath.&nbsp; No man could be a more ardent
admirer than he of the press, to the freedom of which Europe was
principally indebted for its happiness; and God forbid that he
should do anything <!-- page 135--><a name="page135"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 135</span>which would for a moment extinguish
that liberty!&nbsp; The learned counsel for the defendant had
said, that the libel upon a private individual was a species of
moral assassination.&nbsp; It was odd that an individual could
not be libeled with impunity, and yet that society might be set
by the ears.&nbsp; The government were equally protected with all
others against the malevolence and virulence of the press.&nbsp;
He would again repeat, but he would say nothing as to what the
law ought to be, but he stated what it was.&nbsp; What he
conceived to be the true liberty of the press was this, that any
man might, without permission, publish what he please, if he were
responsible for what he might publish.&nbsp; It might be asked,
then is a man answerable for every expression?&nbsp; To that he
would answer, no; if a man&rsquo;s intention were to convince the
people that the government was not acting right, he had a right
to publish his opinions; and if some sparks should fly out beyond
decorum when the real apparent object was to instruct, the
expressions ought not to be visited with punishment.&nbsp; But
men must not go farther than instruct: they must not say that the
system of government is a system of tyranny; which meant nothing
more than that the people ought to pull down such systems.&nbsp;
The learned counsel had alluded to Athens and Rome, but it was
well known that those States punished offences of this
description with greater severity than the laws of England
inflicted.&nbsp; Every man had a right to point out with
firmness, but with respect, the errors of government.&nbsp; Every
man has a right to appeal to the understanding, but not to the
passions; and the man who wished to do so need not be afraid to
write.&nbsp; The distinction between fair discussion and libel
was this, that one was an appeal to the passions, and the other
to the understanding.&nbsp; If the <!-- page 136--><a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>jury were
of opinion that this pamphlet was an address to the people of the
country, to induce them by legal and constitutional means to
procure a redress of grievances, then they would acquit the
defendant; but, if on the other hand, they should be of opinion
that the intention was to appeal to prejudices and passions (as
he thought) it was their bounden duty, whatever they might think
of the propriety or impropriety of the prosecution, to return a
verdict of guilty.&nbsp; He next felt it his duty to remark upon
the passages in the record, and if the learned gentleman had gone
through the pamphlet, he would have found in the next page, in
which the writer said, that the making and administration of laws
was corrupt, a sufficient explanation of what was intended by the
sentence, &ldquo;to talk of the British Constitution,
&amp;c.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was in the country a constitution not
like the Spanish Constitution, created in a day; but matured by
the sense of ages, altering and adapting it to times and
circumstances until it became what was a practical and not
theoretical system of liberty.&nbsp; The learned counsel had made
some observations upon what had fallen from Lord Colchester in
the House of Commons; such observations he thought irregular, but
he permitted them sooner than it should be said that the
defendant, to use a familiar expression, had not &ldquo;fair
play.&rdquo;&nbsp; He did not want the authority of Lord
Colchester with respect to these corruptions, because he had
evidence of it in a case in which he tried twenty-four persons
for such practices.&nbsp; But was it the meaning of the passage,
that there was corruption in the House of Commons?&nbsp; No, the
expression was that the laws (which were corrupt enough to bring
to punishment persons guilty of those practices) were
corrupt.&nbsp; Was this true?&nbsp; If there were anything for
which this country was more distinguished than another <!-- page
137--><a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>it
was the equity of the laws, and it was for this that the laws of
England were extolled by all foreigners.&nbsp; The writer could
not mean the borough of Grampound, or any other borough, when he
said that corruption was the oil of the system.&nbsp; When the
writer said he did not &ldquo;at that moment speak of
insurrection,&rdquo; what was his meaning?&nbsp; Why that
insurrection would not do then, but at some future time they
might, when satisfied of their strength, take advantage of all
circumstances.&nbsp; As far as he understood the nature of the
Manchester and Stockport Rooms they were for instruction, and if
the writer did not go farther, then indeed would the pamphlet be
harmless.&nbsp; &ldquo;Delay some time.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Have
such meetings as those at Manchester and Stockport; be assured of
your numbers, and you can overpower the Government.&rdquo;&nbsp;
There could be no doubt that these passages were libelous.&nbsp;
The next question was, whether the defendant had or had not
published the libel? and it was in evidence that these copies
were purchased at two different times.&nbsp; The jury were not to
take into consideration the former conviction; and he could
assure the jury that no greater severity would be used than was
sufficient to restrain this licentiousness, which, if not
restrained, would overturn this or any other Government.&nbsp;
The revolution recommended by this pamphlet would not be an
ordinary change of masters, but a transfer of property.</p>
<p>At about four o&rsquo;clock the jury retired; and, having
returned at quarter before five,</p>
<p>Mr. Justice <span class="smcap">Best</span> said, he had
received a communication that they were not likely to agree; and
as they must agree at some time or other, he sent for them in
order to give them any information in his power upon such points
as they disagreed upon.</p>
<p><!-- page 138--><a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>A Juror.&mdash;The Foreman was rather precipitate in
writing to your Lordship; we have not wasted much time, and we
are discussing it among ourselves.</p>
<p>Mr. Justice <span class="smcap">Best</span>.&mdash;I am not in
a hurry.</p>
<p>The Foreman said, there were four of the jurors obstinate, and
he would wish his Lordship to draw a juror.</p>
<p>Mr. Justice <span class="smcap">Best</span>.&mdash;I have not
the power to do so.</p>
<p>A Juror.&mdash;I throw back the charge of obstinacy in the
teeth of the Foreman&mdash;he is obstinate.</p>
<p>Another Juryman.&mdash;My Lord there is obstinacy.</p>
<p>Second Juryman.&mdash;This is invidious; I am not the only one
who stands out; there are four of us.</p>
<p>The Foreman again expressed his opinion that they should not
agree.</p>
<p>Mr. Justice <span class="smcap">Best</span>.&mdash;Gentlemen,
you must see the impropriety of this public discussion; you had
better retire, and endeavour to agree among yourselves.</p>
<p>The jury again retired, and at eight o&rsquo;clock desired
their families might be informed that it was not likely they
would return home before the morning.</p>
<h4>Wednesday, July 25th.</h4>
<p>This morning the jury were still enclosed without the least
chance of any agreement.&nbsp; A number of persons were in
waiting to hear the verdict.&nbsp; At half-past nine
o&rsquo;clock, Mr. Justice <span class="smcap">Holroyd</span>
appeared on the bench, and an intimation was conveyed to his
Lordship that there was no probability that the jury would
agree.</p>
<p>A conference took place between the counsel for the
prosecution and defence who appeared to be both willing to enter
a <i>Noli Prosequi</i> and discharge the jury without a
verdict.</p>
<p>A gentleman in black (said to be Mr. Longueville Clarke, one
of the Committee of the Constitutional <!-- page 139--><a
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>Association, and one of the <i>State Locusts</i>)
suddenly started up, and declared that he would not consent to
such a course.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cooper</span> (to the man in
black).&mdash;Are you the attorney for the prosecution, sir?</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Longueville Clarke</span>.&mdash;No: I
am a member of the Constitutional Committee; and <i>I will</i>
have a verdict.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>.&mdash;However potent,
sir, your word might be in the committee-room, it has no power in
this Court.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gurney</span>, as counsel for the
prosecution, in the absence of Mr. <span
class="smcap">Murray</span>, the attorney, would take upon
himself the responsibility of consenting to discharge the
jury.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>, thinking it cruelty to
confine the jury any longer would yield also to a consent for
their discharge.</p>
<p>The jury were then sent for, and in their passage to the Court
were loudly and rapturously cheered by the bystanders.&nbsp;
Having answered to their names,</p>
<p>Mr. Justice <span class="smcap">Holroyd</span> addressed
them.&mdash;Gentlemen of the jury, I am glad that it is in my
power to relieve you from your present unpleasant
situation.&nbsp; The learned counsel on both sides have consented
to discharge you without your returning a verdict.</p>
<p>The jury then left the Court, and were again loudly cheered in
their passage through the Hall.</p>
<p>Thus ended the first attempt of the Constitutional
Association, or the Bridge-street Banditti, to get a verdict;
particularly important to the country&mdash;particularly
honourable to the counsel for the defendant, and the honest
Jurors who made so noble a stand for the Liberty of the
Press&mdash;and particularly disgraceful to all parties connected
with the prosecution.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
